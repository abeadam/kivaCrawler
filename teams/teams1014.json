                "description": "Alan's account of the founding of LLL is on the  team board @Alan re: #260143. Loans that are nearing expiry won't get funded if they don't get noticed. We look for loans that are about to expire by using the Sort By:\r\n\"Expiring Soon\" option instead of the default \"Popularity\", and then work to get them funded.\r\n\r\nSee our team FAQ, linked above (the \"Team Website\" button, next to our traffic light avatar).\r\n\r\nA Team LLL glossary (contributed by team member Tony):\r\n\r\nRed Loans: Loans that have less than five days to be funded, identifiable by the red box \r\nwith the notice that says \"Only x days left!\" or \r\n\"Only x hours and y minutes left!\"\r\n\r\nLLL - Late Loaning Lenders: this team, where \r\nlenders work together to keep loans from \r\nexpiring.\r\n\r\nSFDD - Starfish Daily Dozen: Under current \r\npractice, one of these lists is prepared and \r\nposted for each day, to help LLL lenders focus \r\nand coordinate their lending on a targeted \r\ngroup of loans (the Starfish or SF). The lists \r\nare prepared by a group of volunteers who \r\nseek to be objective in selecting the loans to \r\nbe included in their lists. They also seek to \r\nspread out the loans in each list over a 24 hour \r\nperiod and to share the joy among the Field \r\nPartners with loans expiring during that period, \r\nbut their efforts are always constrained by the \r\nchoice of loans that are available for inclusion \r\nin the list. Loans with larger amounts needed \r\nwill be included in the period immediately after \r\neach Credit Day, when lenders are feeling \r\nflush, but the lists will become less ambitious \r\nwhen the LLL lenders are feeling poor.\r\n\r\nGG - Gorgeous Group: The SFDD list-makers have the option of adding one or two of these \r\nloans after their SFDD lists. As the name \r\nimplies, only group loans are picked. When it is \r\nfirst posted, a typical GG loan will expire two \r\ndays or more after the list is posted. It will \r\nusually be retained as a GG until it becomes \r\nFully Funded or moves into Starfish range. The amount needed when the loan is selected as a GG will vary depending on the time of month.\r\n\r\nRTR - Reduce the Red: These lists are \r\nprepared and posted when there are large \r\nnumbers of loans slated to expire in a short \r\nperiod of time. \"Red\" is a reference to the red \r\nboxes that are added to a loan description \r\nwhen the Loan is about to expire without full \r\nfunding.\r\n\r\nBTB - Battling the Boxes: On those days where \r\nthere aren't 12 loans that qualify as \"Starfish,\" \r\nthe listmakers will include BTB loans to help \r\nfocus attention on the red-boxed loans with the best chances. The criteria are similar to SF \r\nloans, i.e., one per field partner and reasonable \r\namounts left to fund (not too much; not too \r\nlittle), except that these loans may have a longer time left before their expiry date. If they gain good traction on their first BTB day, they may be carried forward. If not ... they stand a second chance as SF.\r\n\r\nBulge: A short period in which a great many \r\nloans have their scheduled funding expiration \r\ntimes. Bulges come about primarily when a \r\nField Partner (FP) submits an amount of loans \r\nto Kiva than is greater than the FP's quota. The loan \r\ndescriptions are prepared for posting by \r\ntranslating the loan descriptions (if necessary) \r\nand editing them, and they are then held in a queue by Kiva's server, to be posted when the FP has freed up some of its credit limit on Kiva, by making some repayments. Bulge loans are prize candidates for inclusion \r\nin Reduce the Red lists.\r\n\r\nFF - Fully Funded: This is LLL code for a loan \r\nthat has received all the loans required for it to be removed from the list of loans that are raising funds \r\nand to move into paying back status.\r\n\r\nLars Ratio: the average funding per hour that is needed for a loan to become fully funded.\r\n(Developed by team member Lars)\r\n\r\nWiedergänger (contributed by Maria) - German expression, literal translation \"again walker,\" meaning \"undead,\" i.e. a person that has died but comes back, aka a zombie. Here it means a loan that disappears from the page, but comes back again because somebody didn't check out their basket.\r\n\r\nRuma sana (contributed by Jouko and Potkukelkka) - Finnish expression, literal translation \"ugly words.\"  It is a phrase to use when you are very frustrated, but want to stop just short of actual cursing -- for example, when the Kiva site repeatedly logs you out when you are trying to rescue an expiring loan at the last second.\r\n\r\nSee data about all loans currently fundraising on Kiva:\r\nwww.kivatools.com\r\nSee data about loans that have been mentioned on the LLL board, including the most recent lending activity on each loan:\r\nhttp://starfish.dynalias.org/\r\nSee loans in real time, as they are made:\r\nhttp://www.http://kivalive.com/index2.php\r\n\r\nLists are posted on the LLL Team message \r\nboard.

It discovers the benefits and drawbacks of an alternative blueprint for sustained growth based on the needs of the people, cutting off the Wabenzi’s (men of Mercedes Benz in Swahili) 70-year access to a bottomless pot of tainted aid-gold. \r\n\r\nThe production saw us driving overland from Geneva, Switzerland to Cape Town, South Africa to covering case studies at grass roots level in some of the most remote regions of Africa. \r\n\r\nWe followed and discovered local communities and their entrepreneurial stars who, with the use of innovative entrepreneurial mechanisms, finance development to assuage poverty. We lived with these communities and experience the rebirth of their continent. \r\n\r\nGet involved! Share your thoughts, here or on our website www.africabeyondaid.org",

It discovers the benefits and drawbacks of an alternative blueprint for sustained growth based on the needs of the people, cutting off the Wabenzi’s (men of Mercedes Benz in Swahili) 70-year access to a bottomless pot of tainted aid-gold. \r\n\r\nThe production saw us driving overland from Geneva, Switzerland to Cape Town, South Africa to covering case studies at grass roots level in some of the most remote regions of Africa. \r\n\r\nWe followed and discovered local communities and their entrepreneurial stars who, with the use of innovative entrepreneurial mechanisms, finance development to assuage poverty. We lived with these communities and experience the rebirth of their continent. \r\n\r\nGet involved! Share your thoughts, here or on our website www.africabeyondaid.org",

We focus on inspiring African entrepreneurial development as an alternative to the western aid model.\r\n\r\nAfrica Beyond Aid is NOT a charity, we are an overland expedition team of passionate individuals producing a self-funded TV and Web documentary on the emergence of an inspiring generation of Africans working towards economic freedom. \r\n\r\nWe ask whether the aid model devised by the West has dumped Africa into a vicious cycle of perpetual infancy and aid dependence resulting in civil unrest, human rights abuse, corruption and economic demise? \r\n\r\nNote: we are talking bilateral and multilateral aid here (development aid), not emergency and humanitarian aid!\r\n\r\nThis documentary investigates and reports on inspiring African entrepreneurial development as an alternative to the western aid model. It discovers the benefits and drawbacks of an alternative blueprint for sustained growth based on the needs of the people, cutting off the Wabenzi’s (men of Mercedes Benz in Swahili) 70-year access to a bottomless pot of tainted aid-gold. \r\n\r\nThe production saw us driving overland from Geneva, Switzerland to Cape Town, South Africa to covering case studies at grass roots level in some of the most remote regions of Africa. \r\n\r\nWe followed and discovered local communities and their entrepreneurial stars who, with the use of innovative entrepreneurial mechanisms, finance development to assuage poverty. We lived with these communities and experience the rebirth of their continent. \r\n\r\nGet involved! Share your thoughts, here or on our website www.africabeyondaid.org",

We focus on inspiring African entrepreneurial development as an alternative to the western aid model.\r\n\r\nAfrica Beyond Aid is NOT a charity, we are an overland expedition team of passionate individuals producing a self-funded TV and Web documentary on the emergence of an inspiring generation of Africans working towards economic freedom. \r\n\r\nWe ask whether the aid model devised by the West has dumped Africa into a vicious cycle of perpetual infancy and aid dependence resulting in civil unrest, human rights abuse, corruption and economic demise? \r\n\r\nNote: we are talking bilateral and multilateral aid here (development aid), not emergency and humanitarian aid!\r\n\r\nThis documentary investigates and reports on inspiring African entrepreneurial development as an alternative to the western aid model. It discovers the benefits and drawbacks of an alternative blueprint for sustained growth based on the needs of the people, cutting off the Wabenzi’s (men of Mercedes Benz in Swahili) 70-year access to a bottomless pot of tainted aid-gold. \r\n\r\nThe production saw us driving overland from Geneva, Switzerland to Cape Town, South Africa to covering case studies at grass roots level in some of the most remote regions of Africa. \r\n\r\nWe followed and discovered local communities and their entrepreneurial stars who, with the use of innovative entrepreneurial mechanisms, finance development to assuage poverty. We lived with these communities and experience the rebirth of their continent. \r\n\r\nGet involved! Share your thoughts, here or on our website www.africabeyondaid.org",

We are creating awareness for direct investment as an alternative model for African Economic Development.\r\n\r\nIn one sentence: We investigate an alternative, inspirational blueprint for African development as the 'aid model' was proven to be grossly ineffective in Africa over the past 60 years. \r\n\r\nWe certainly do not think we have the answer to everything and cannot cover every single variable in this documentary, but we do say: Look, these people are making a success despite their lack of resources and without aid, so maybe we should look at ways to support them directly, rather than categorising Africans as aid-dependents or god forbid - trust their/our corrupt governments to help out.",

CORENA's projects are all based in Australia and are funded through our website, corenafund.org.au. The loans made on Kiva in the name of this Lending Team are in no way funded by donations made to CORENA. \r\n\r\nCORENA (Citizens Own Renewable Energy Network Australia Inc) is a people-powered funding mechanism, not unlike Kiva, designed to speed up the transition to 100% renewable energy. \r\n\r\n**Quick Win project fund (rolling)\r\nCORENA uses the donated funds to give an interest-free loan to a non-profit community organisation to pay for solar panels (and other efficiency measures), and they pay back the loan out of subsequent savings on their power bills (it doesn't cost them a cent!). The loan repayments then go towards funding the next Quick Win project. CORENA was formed in 2013, and has already completed two installations, which are now helping fund the 3rd project: solar for Beechworth Montessori School.\r\n\r\n**Big Win project fund \r\nWe plan to build Australia's first community-owned, large scale (50MW) Solar Thermal plant with molten salt storage at Port Augusta, in South Australia. The plant will provide cheap, clean energy that never runs out, and will be owned collectively by ‘the people’ and operated for the benefit of all. If around 720,000 people each contribute $8 per week for ONE year, we can fund this project entirely by donations. There’ll be no loan repayments or dividends to shareholders, so all profits will be used to build yet more people’s solar plants.",
