The resulting disease causes nearly 2 million deaths, 10% of the global disease burden, and $84 billion in worker productivity loss each year. The high population density combined with the lack of infrastructure and resources makes the problem particularly acute in slums, where populations will double to 2 billion by 2030. Kenya is at the epicenter of this crisis with 10 million people living in slums, 80% of whom lack access to basic sanitation.",

Sanergy creates an efficient, equitable, and sustainable sanitation cycle by building a dense network of small-scale sanitation centers across the slums, a low-cost containerized waste collection infrastructure, and converting this waste at a central processing facility into electricity, fertilizer, and other high-margin products.\r\n\r\nSanergy is an official Kiva field partner.",
