Loans give clients the ability to maintain farmland and expand production.  Technical assistance helps farmers with business strategy and empowers them with the knowledge necessary to improve crop yields.  Market access services link producers to buyers, which can be facilitated through their assistance with helping farmers obtain various certifications for organic and/or sustainably grown products, such as Fair Trade, 4C, and Starbucks’ C.A.F.E Practices.  Through their comprehensive model, PAC empowers borrowers with the knowledge, resources, and connections that lead to sustainable success.",

Chris Guillebeau & an anonymous donor made a $100 investment in each of the attendees, and left US with a simple charge: put it to good use! Start a project, surprise someone, or do something entirely different. Some team members may use their $100 this way, others may just divert their normal Kiva lending to this team. I just wanted to TAKE immediate action and DO SOMETHING within 24 hours of returning home. This is it! ",
