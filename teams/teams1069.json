They have close ties with community leaders, in various tribes and regions and aligns their work with the needs of the communities, therefore going into isolated hill regions where other forms of capital are not available.   They lend to women over the age of 55, which is unusual for microlending organizations in India.   They provide clients with loans to purchase solar lamps, which is especially impactful because most of the areas WSDS works in do not have electricity. Political unrest and frequent economic blockades in the area make it very difficult to provide services, resulting in Manipur having the lowest penetration of financial services in the country.",

The effect would be two-fold: Not only would local communities receive benefit at the grassroots level, but students would also be exposed to opportunities in the humanitarian field. GPE functions to foster the construction of a new civilization founded on mutual cooperation and understanding to support development and peace in the world.\r\n\r\nBuilding upon a network of linked universities and partners, students travel and work on projects with partners in the various regions of the world. They also participate in activities to provide them with a knowledge of global issues and development ideology. The hope is that students achieve a shared understanding of the common human struggle to survive, a moral and ethical education about the issues affecting a particular area or culture, and the hope to aid in the building of a new “civilization” of humanity. The best way to achieve these goals among the youth of today lies in service, as actions will always speak louder than words.",
