Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

                "description": "Alan's account of the founding of LLL is on the  team board @Alan re: #260143. Loans that are nearing expiry won't get funded if they don't get noticed. We look for loans that are about to expire by using the Sort By:\r\n\"Expiring Soon\" option instead of the default \"Popularity\", and then work to get them funded.\r\n\r\nSee our team FAQ, linked above (the \"Team Website\" button, next to our traffic light avatar).\r\n\r\nA Team LLL glossary (contributed by team member Tony):\r\n\r\nRed Loans: Loans that have less than five days to be funded, identifiable by the red box with the notice that says \"Only x days left!\" or \r\n\"Only x hours and y minutes left!\"\r\n\r\nLLL - Late Loaning Lenders: this team, where \r\nlenders work together to keep loans from \r\nexpiring.\r\n\r\nSFDD - Starfish Daily Dozen: Under current \r\npractice, one of these lists is prepared and \r\nposted for each day, to help LLL lenders focus \r\nand coordinate their lending on a targeted \r\ngroup of loans (the Starfish or SF). The lists \r\nare prepared by a group of volunteers who \r\nseek to be objective in selecting the loans to \r\nbe included in their lists. They also seek to \r\nspread out the loans in each list over a 24 hour \r\nperiod and to share the joy among the Field \r\nPartners with loans expiring during that period, \r\nbut their efforts are always constrained by the \r\nchoice of loans that are available for inclusion \r\nin the list. Loans with larger amounts needed \r\nwill be included in the period immediately after \r\neach Credit Day, when lenders are feeling \r\nflush, but the lists will become less ambitious \r\nwhen the LLL lenders are feeling poor.\r\n\r\nGG - Gorgeous Group: The SFDD list-makers usually add one or two of these loans at the end of the SF daily dozen lists. As the name \r\nimplies, only group loans are picked. When it is \r\nfirst posted, a typical GG loan will expire two \r\ndays or more after the list is posted. It will \r\nusually be retained as a GG until it becomes \r\nFully Funded or moves into Starfish range. The amount needed when the loan is selected as a GG will vary depending on the time of month.\r\n\r\nOPM - Abbreviation for \"other people's money.\"  Our main lending method is to coordinate LLL team members' loans, so that we make several loans to a borrower within a short period of time. This will move the borrower's loan request up in Kiva's \"popularity\" sort and get the loan noticed by other people (non-members of the LLL team).  Many loans then get their funding completed by loans from those non-LLL members.  By attracting other lenders' attention to our Starfish loans in this way, we multiply the impact of our finite funds, and save more loans from expiring than we otherwise could.\r\n\r\nRTR - Reduce the Red: These lists are \r\nprepared and posted when there are large \r\nnumbers of loans slated to expire in a short \r\nperiod of time. \"Red\" is a reference to the red \r\nboxes that are added to a loan description \r\nwhen the Loan is about to expire without full \r\nfunding.\r\n\r\nBulge: A short period in which a great many loans have their scheduled funding expiration times. This may happen when, for example, the volunteer coordinators at Kiva offer a promo of some kind to the editors & translators, to get them to do a lot of work in a very short period of time. Bulge loans are prime candidates for inclusion in Reduce the Red lists.\r\n\r\nBTB - Battling the Boxes: On those days where \r\nthere aren't 12 loans that qualify as \"Starfish,\" the listmakers will include loans that have their red boxes, but more than 24 hours left before their deadline, to make up the 12 loans for the list. The criteria are similar to SF \r\nloans, i.e., one per field partner and reasonable \r\namounts left to fund (not too much; not too \r\nlittle), except that these loans may have a longer time left before their expiry date. If they gain good traction on their first BTB day, they may be carried forward. If not ... they stand a second chance as SF.\r\n\r\nFF - Fully Funded: This is LLL code for a loan \r\nthat has received all the loans required for it to be removed from the list of loans that are raising funds \r\nand to move into paying back status.\r\n\r\nLars Ratio: the average funding per hour that is needed for a loan to become fully funded.\r\n(Developed by team member Lars)\r\n\r\nWiedergänger (contributed by Maria) - German expression, literal translation \"again walker,\" meaning \"undead,\" i.e. a person that has died but comes back, aka a zombie. Here it means a loan that disappears from the page, but comes back again because somebody didn't check out their basket.\r\n\r\nRuma sana (contributed by Jouko and Potkukelkka) - Finnish expression, literal translation \"ugly words.\"  It is a phrase to use when you are very frustrated, but want to stop just short of actual cursing -- for example, when the Kiva site repeatedly logs you out when you are trying to rescue an expiring loan at the last second.\r\n\r\nSee data about all loans currently fundraising on Kiva:\r\nwww.kivatools.com\r\nSee data about loans that have been mentioned on the LLL board, including the most recent lending activity on each loan:\r\nhttp://starfish.dynalias.org/\r\nSee loans in real time, as they are made:\r\nhttp://www.http://kivalive.com/index2.php\r\n\r\nLists are posted on the LLL Team message \r\nboard.

A sort of catch-all the accepts everyone no matter what your interests, location, or background.\r\n\r\nOne of the best videos on microfinance: www.goo.gl/sVkdK4 It's of Muhammad Yunus, the developer of microfinance.\r\n\r\nWe want to grow Kiva by inviting people to it.  Kiva's invite rate is 0.28 (as of 1.17.13). If we could bring that to 1.0 or near 1.0, Kiva would grow near exponentially.  All a 1.0 invite rate means is that each person on Kiva successfully invites just one other new person to Kiva.  I know we can do it. You can generally invite people to Kiva here: https://www.kiva.org/portfolio/invites  or specifically to team Universe and Kiva here: http://www.kiva.org/team/universe/recruit\r\n\r\nAnother interesting tidbit: \"The microfinance sector currently has an estimated total loan volume of USD 25 bn. Yet, it is unable to serve more than a fraction (~100 m) of today's total sector demand of roughly 1 bn micro-borrowers. This situation translates into an immense funding gap estimated at around USD 250 bn.\" see www.goo.gl/Lg6hIC\r\n\r\nWe want our team to be a catch all that anyone with any interest can join. But we also want to invite tons of other people to join Kiva. Let's make Kiva grow.\r\n\r\n***** There might be free $25 loan if someone accepts your invite. Go to: https://www.kiva.org/portfolio/invites\r\n\r\nAnother name for our team could be \"All\" or \"Other\" because we are a catch all for anything and everything else.  Everyone is encouraged to join this team, no matter what your interests.\r\n\r\nSure, we want to lend to others. But perhaps even more important is to invite all of our friends through email, Facebook, and whatever else.\r\n\r\nWe want more and more people to use Kiva through whatever means available, including telling our friends, Kiva gifts cards, Twitter, and, when available, the free $25 first-timer loans: https://www.kiva.org/portfolio/invites\r\n\r\nMy story is an interesting example: I've invited hundreds, if not thousands of people, primarily by using my email contacts, but also through Facebook. I've only been able to make 33 loans so far, but my successful invitees have collectively made 34 loans.  Out of the hundreds or thousand of invites I've sent out, only 3 have been successful.  But those invites have had a greater total dollar impact than my own lending.\r\n\r\nWhen you look at the successful invites that my invites have sent, the impact is even greater.\r\n\r\nMost of us can make a little difference by lending a little of our money, but we can make a huge difference by getting a few of our friends to lend a little money as well, and then passing it on down the line.\r\n\r\nMy journey with Kiva all started with my sister giving me a gift card, it took almost the whole year, just before it expired, for me to even use it. Don't get discouraged if your invites seem to go unnoticed. It might take thousands of invites before someone accepts and makes their first loan.  But that person might be Bill Gates, or might invite Bill Gates.\r\n\r\nI don't think most people join Kiva because they stumbled upon it, they join it because they were invited by someone just like you.\r\n\r\nWere you invited to Kiva?",
