She was always ready with a hug for anyone who needed one, even when they didn't know it yet.  Loaning Becky's memory keeps her love alive, spreading her love around the world!",
                "description": "We are a group of people who have been inspired by the love of a young lady named Becky, who was tragically killed 30 August 2010 at the age of 9½.  She loved unconditionally, and was always ready with a hug, even for complete strangers.  The living memorial of sharing hugs began immediately after her death, when her mother told her classmates to hug each other every day in her memory.  This team keeps Becky's love alive by sharing her hugs in the form of loans around the world.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about Becky and the impact of her short life, visit BeckysHugs.com, which will point you to the Becky's Hugs page on Facebook.
