Their parents are so poor they could never afford surgery. Being born with a cleft in a developing country is truly a curse, and no one knows how many newborns with clefts are killed or abandoned right after birth.  \r\n\r\nThrough Smile Train's free cleft surgery program, a 45 minute surgery gives these children a future and a second chance at life that they never thought they'd get. Let's change the world, one smile at a time!\r\n\r\nThrough our Kiva lending we want to raise awareness and support of the wonderful work Smile Train does in providing free cleft repair surgeries around the world. If our team logo is displayed on loans' top lending teams we hope other Kiva lenders will learn about Smile Train's work too.  Won't you join us?\r\n.\r\n",
                "description": "We are a diverse group of Kiva lenders from different backgrounds and different areas of the world who share a common desire to support the effort to bring a repair surgery to every child who needs one.  Our team also includes staff members of Smile Train and Kiva and other microfinance ventures.  We would be happy for you to join our team too!\r\n\r\nThe little girl in our team logo is Pinki Sonkar.  She was born with a severe cleft into a family that was surviving on less than a dollar a day in a poor rural village in India. She could not go to school because the other children threw rocks at her.  Smile Pinki tells the story of how her life was changed forever by a free repair surgery at a Smile Train partner hospital.  Contact a team captain for more information if you would like a free DVD of this Academy Award winning documentary.\r\n\r\nWhere is Pinki Now - http://bit.ly/WhereisPinkiNow - This 5 minute video has interviews with Pinki's parents and teachers and video of Pinki in school.  You can see that cleft surgery brings a total transformation to the lives of these kids.\r\n\r\nWang Li Got Married - http://bit.ly/WangLi - this video tells the moving story of Smile Train's very first patient and how her life was totally changed.\r\n\r\nSmile Train in Mexico - http://bit.ly/SmileMexico - this video is for Adrián and the Arenal Group. As a team we loaned to help his parents, and we hope that through Smile Train Adrián will get the care that he needs.\r\n\r\nKiva Team Smile Train fund raiser page - http://bit.ly/DonateTeamSmileTrain - If you would like to make donation to support Smile Train's work you can do so here.

Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

Sufferers are afflicted by an absence of melanin, a pigmentation defect in the hair, skin and eyes. It causes vulnerability to sun exposure and bright light. Many have very poor vision as a consequence. In tropical countries especially they can be vulnerable to skin cancers if unprotected from the sun.\r\n\r\nThough it might seem absurdly obvious, Albinism has nothing to do with magical powers. \r\n\r\nBut in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, albinos have traditionally faced discrimination and prejudice. They are associated with the supernatural. To some, a white-skinned African person is seen as a kind of phantom or ghost, who rather than die will dissolve or disappear with the wind and rain. \r\n\r\nOver the last five years in Tanzania, however, the situation has become much, much worse, with albinos increasingly subjected to murder and mutilation because of a completely absurd myth that albino body parts are effective in witchcraft rituals. Albino bones are also used as good luck charms and people believe they can make you rich.\r\n",
                "description": "Attacks on albinos continue, despite international outrage and repeated attempts by the Tanzanian government to stamp out this truly appalling practice, since it first came to light that many albinos have been hunted down and attacked purely for their limbs and organs. \r\n\r\nOfficially there are around 8,000 albinos registered by the Tanzania Albino Society (TAS), but they says the real number is in excess of 170,000. Many albinos are still kept hidden by their families because of the stigma or because of fear that they might be attacked.\r\n\r\nPlease check following documentary: http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/africainvestigates/2011/11/201111185428766652.html\r\nMeet two albino children, victims of vicious assault. A 12-year-old boy called Adam (see team photo), who had part of his hand cut off and a 16-year-old girl, whose arm was hacked off. Their body parts sold for witchcraft rituals or good luck charms. (You may find some of the images disturbing)\r\n\r\nMore info:\r\nTAS accepted the Martin Luther King Major Drum for Justice Award on behalf of albinos living in Tanzania in a ceremony at the US Embassy on January 15th 2009.\r\n\r\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7148673.stm\r\n\r\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/08/world/africa/08albino.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1\r\n\r\nhttp://www.add.org.uk/case_study.asp?ref=94\r\n",
