We believe that \r\nthis will damage the Field Partners in the long \r\nterm and impair their capacity to make loans to new borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe can't save every red loan, but we try to\r\nmake a difference as in the Starfish Story:\r\nhttp://67.199.70.191/articles/the-starfish-story.aspx\r\nHelp us fund loans we're already supporting:\r\nhttp://www.kiva.org/team/late_loaning_lenders/loans?status=fundRaising\r\n\r\n\r\nCheck out Charlotte's Web: http://starfish.dynalias.org\r\n\r\nThis watchlist for loans suggested by the team members (starfish + offlist) shows:\r\n* the current position in the popularity ranking (considering pages 1 to 5)\r\n* the timestamp of the most recent loan\r\n* the basket amount\r\nClick magnifier icon for more info.

                "description": "Alan's account of the founding of LLL is on the  team board @Alan re: #260143. Loans that are nearing expiry won't get funded if they don't get noticed. We look for loans that are about to expire by using the Sort By:\r\n\"Expiring Soon\" option instead of the default \"Popularity\", and then work to get them funded.\r\n\r\nSee our team FAQ, linked above (the \"Team Website\" button, next to our traffic light avatar).\r\n\r\nA Team LLL glossary (contributed by team member Tony):\r\n\r\nRed Loans: Loans that have less than five days to be funded, identifiable by the red box with the notice that says \"Only x days left!\" or \r\n\"Only x hours and y minutes left!\"\r\n\r\nLLL - Late Loaning Lenders: this team, where \r\nlenders work together to keep loans from \r\nexpiring.\r\n\r\nSFDD - Starfish Daily Dozen: Under current \r\npractice, one of these lists is prepared and \r\nposted for each day, to help LLL lenders focus \r\nand coordinate their lending on a targeted \r\ngroup of loans (the Starfish or SF). The lists \r\nare prepared by a group of volunteers who \r\nseek to be objective in selecting the loans to \r\nbe included in their lists. They also seek to \r\nspread out the loans in each list over a 24 hour \r\nperiod and to share the joy among the Field \r\nPartners with loans expiring during that period, \r\nbut their efforts are always constrained by the \r\nchoice of loans that are available for inclusion \r\nin the list. Loans with larger amounts needed \r\nwill be included in the period immediately after \r\neach Credit Day, when lenders are feeling \r\nflush, but the lists will become less ambitious \r\nwhen the LLL lenders are feeling poor.\r\n\r\nGG - Gorgeous Group: The SFDD list-makers usually add one or two of these loans at the end of the SF daily dozen lists. As the name \r\nimplies, only group loans are picked. When it is \r\nfirst posted, a typical GG loan will expire two \r\ndays or more after the list is posted. It will \r\nusually be retained as a GG until it becomes \r\nFully Funded or moves into Starfish range. The amount needed when the loan is selected as a GG will vary depending on the time of month.\r\n\r\nOPM - Abbreviation for \"other people's money.\"  Our main lending method is to coordinate LLL team members' loans, so that we make several loans to a borrower within a short period of time. This will move the borrower's loan request up in Kiva's \"popularity\" sort and get the loan noticed by other people (non-members of the LLL team).  Many loans then get their funding completed by loans from those non-LLL members.  By attracting other lenders' attention to our Starfish loans in this way, we multiply the impact of our finite funds, and save more loans from expiring than we otherwise could.\r\n\r\nRTR - Reduce the Red: These lists are \r\nprepared and posted when there are large \r\nnumbers of loans slated to expire in a short \r\nperiod of time. \"Red\" is a reference to the red \r\nboxes that are added to a loan description \r\nwhen the Loan is about to expire without full \r\nfunding.\r\n\r\nBulge: A short period in which a great many loans have their scheduled funding expiration times. This may happen when, for example, the volunteer coordinators at Kiva offer a promo of some kind to the editors & translators, to get them to do a lot of work in a very short period of time. Bulge loans are prime candidates for inclusion in Reduce the Red lists.\r\n\r\nBTB - Battling the Boxes: On those days where \r\nthere aren't 12 loans that qualify as \"Starfish,\" the listmakers will include loans that have their red boxes, but more than 24 hours left before their deadline, to make up the 12 loans for the list. The criteria are similar to SF \r\nloans, i.e., one per field partner and reasonable \r\namounts left to fund (not too much; not too \r\nlittle), except that these loans may have a longer time left before their expiry date. If they gain good traction on their first BTB day, they may be carried forward. If not ... they stand a second chance as SF.\r\n\r\nFF - Fully Funded: This is LLL code for a loan \r\nthat has received all the loans required for it to be removed from the list of loans that are raising funds \r\nand to move into paying back status.\r\n\r\nLars Ratio: the average funding per hour that is needed for a loan to become fully funded.\r\n(Developed by team member Lars)\r\n\r\nWiedergänger (contributed by Maria) - German expression, literal translation \"again walker,\" meaning \"undead,\" i.e. a person that has died but comes back, aka a zombie. Here it means a loan that disappears from the page, but comes back again because somebody didn't check out their basket.\r\n\r\nRuma sana (contributed by Jouko and Potkukelkka) - Finnish expression, literal translation \"ugly words.\"  It is a phrase to use when you are very frustrated, but want to stop just short of actual cursing -- for example, when the Kiva site repeatedly logs you out when you are trying to rescue an expiring loan at the last second.\r\n\r\nSee data about all loans currently fundraising on Kiva:\r\nwww.kivatools.com\r\nSee data about loans that have been mentioned on the LLL board, including the most recent lending activity on each loan:\r\nhttp://starfish.dynalias.org/\r\nSee loans in real time, as they are made:\r\nhttp://www.http://kivalive.com/index2.php\r\n\r\nLists are posted on the LLL Team message \r\nboard.

That same day Vietnam War veteran Ron Paul M.D. would enter politics.  Congressman Ron Paul was among the first to support Ronald Reagan in his Presidential campaign due to his beliefs in limited-federal government, sound money, personal liberty, and freedom.  A conservative Libertarian-Republican; Dr. Ron Paul has achieved the most conservative voting record in Congress since 1937.  He is also a published author and is considered by many “The Champion of the Constitution.”  Ron Paul M.D. winner of the Republican CPAC straw poll and a great American patriot is currently on track to defeat incumbent President Barack Obama in the 2012 Presidential election.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease watch:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWyygiyPbdA\r\n\r\n \r\nWant to learn more?\r\n\r\n \r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vthdr96EDnE\r\n\r\n \r\nAugust 10, 1977 – Mr. America “Hulk Hogan” 12 time world heavyweight champion is born and would later help to deter and tear down communism throughout the modern world.\r\n\r\n\r\nWant to learn more?\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjWDrTXMgF8\r\n\r\n \r\nNovember 1984 – President Ronald Reagan is re-elected with a landslide election winning 49 of the 50 U.S. states.

Towards the end of his Presidency he would finally put an end to the Cold War with the tearing down of the Berlin Wall and liberating Germany from under Communist rule.  Reaganomics would live on throughout the 90s until the Democrat Carter-Era Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and mandated sub-prime loans of the mid 90s led to the modern financial crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease watch:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wusgcG4rfo\r\n\r\n\r\nWant to learn more?\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRdLpem-AAs\r\n\r\n \r\n1996 – Alex Jones, a radio broadcaster, begins his fight against tyranny world-wide.\r\n\r\n\r\nWant to learn more?\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ku5u6X6LmM\r\n\r\n \r\n2003 – Two-term President George W. Bush liberates Iraq and Afghanistan ending decades of tyranny in the Middle East.  Amidst rising oil prices from a falling U.S. dollar and under pressure George W. Bush knowing the hazards of offshore drilling reluctantly lifts the offshore drilling ban in 2008 saying “This means that the only thing standing between the American people and these vast oil reserves is action from the U.S. Congress.” George W. Bush’s worst fears would become reality shortly after leaving office President Obama further supported lifting the offshore drilling plan leading up to the worst oil spill in World history devastating the gulf regions.  The Bush administration also attempted to reign in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Mortgage lenders warning of an impending financial meltdown unless regulators act.  These warning fell on deaf ears and nothing was done to stop the financial crisis.  Before leaving office George W. Bush did what little he could to help stimulate and save the U.S. economy by arranging massive bailouts so that American workers could keep their jobs and avoid or postponing a 2nd Great Depression.\r\n\r\n \r\nPlease watch:\r\n\r\n \r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMnSp4qEXNM\r\n\r\n\r\nWant to learn more?\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8gzfpl2V_c\r\n\r\n \r\n2005 – Chuck Norris, a martial arts expert and Christian book writer, becomes an American Legend.\r\n\r\n\r\nWant to learn more?\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-h1vgIPSCA\r\n\r\n \r\n2006 – Peyton Manning, a 4-time NFL MVP, wins the Super Bowl.\r\n\r\n\r\nWant to learn more?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng1x1sDpdWs\r\n\r\n \r\n2010- Peter Schiff, a financial expert on the economy as well as a published author and Ron Paul’s chief economic advisor and predictor of the U.S. financial crisis of 2008, is campaigning in Connecticut to become a U.S. Senator.

Over 2.4 million people took action through DoSomething.org in 2012. Why? Because apathy sucks.",
