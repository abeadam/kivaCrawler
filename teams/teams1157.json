Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

He graduated with a Bachelor’s Degree in Civil Engineering and a Master’s Degree in Engineering Management (MSEM) from Syracuse University. The MSEM program helps working engineers and scientists become better managers as well as  become prepared for increased responsibilities in management. The degree program provided Sirel with knowledge in management theory and practices, statistics, quality control, finance, economics, information/data management, and legal issues. With this specialized knowledge and training, Sirel has lead and developed the engineering and construction department at the Virginia Railway Express (VRE) for the past ten years.\r\n\r\nWhile working for VRE, Sirel quickly rose through the ranks due to his ability to execute projects on time and under budget. His direct construction experience provides the added value of ensuring project constructability with minimal potential for contractor claims. Prior to joining the VRE, Sirel has worked in both the private and public sector leading and participating in major capital projects. Sirel is a licensed Professional Engineer in multiple states and a certified construction manager. Regulation and licensing in engineering is performed by the individual states and is only valid in the state it is granted. This process was created to protect the general public and ensure that the engineer is prepared to provide services.\r\n\r\nIn his spare time, Sirel enjoys spending time with his family and working on home improvement projects. Sirel is also a huge soccer fan and continues to be active in the sport with multiple leagues in the DC, Virginia and Maryland areas. ",

                "loan_because": "Mark Bronner is a respected diamond dealer in the greater New York area. He has been in the diamond business in the tri-state area for nearly two decades.\r\n\r\nOriginally, Mark Bronner hails from the Philadelphia suburb of Downingtown, Pennsylvania. He was one of five children. Mark Bronner’s father was an economics professor at Penn and his mother worked at St. Joseph’s Hospital.\r\n\r\nGrowing up, the boys knew the value of hard work. Starting at the age of 15, each of the four Bronner boys worked construction at Daniel J. Keating for 40 hours a week in the summers.\r\n\r\nBronner enrolled at Malvern Prep, like his three older brothers. While his brothers played hockey and tennis, Bronner was drawn to football and lacrosse. Football came easy to Bronner, and he started on the Malvern prep team as a sophomore safety. Lacrosse proved more difficult, and Bronner considered quitting the Friars lacrosse team as a sophomore. However, in his final and senior campaign, Mark Bronner became a starter at long stick midfield and earned a partial scholarship to the University of Delaware.\r\n\r\nWhile at the University of Delaware, Mark Bronner initially majored in Biology. He intended to be medical doctor. However, while in school, his father, James Bronner, left Penn to move into the private sector. Mark Bronner became drawn to Business, and graduated with a Bachelors of Science.\r\n\r\nFollowing college, Bronner got hired at his old company, Keating Construction. In a supply-chain management role, Mark Bronner helped the company expand its footprint significantly and improved efficiency. By the time he was thirty, Bronner moved into a management role. He aided in the acquisition of some smaller construction firms in his managerial position.\r\n\r\nBronner noticed his own ability to recognize sound business, and began a career in personal investing. He started by investing in small chain restaurants in the Philadelphia suburbs. Bronner diversified by getting into commodities, specifically energy. However, when a former teammate from the Delaware Blue Hen lacrosse team came to him with an opportunity with diamonds, Bronner could not pass it up",
