Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

We believe that \r\nthis will damage the Field Partners in the long \r\nterm and impair their capacity to make loans to new borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe can't save every red loan, but we try to\r\nmake a difference as in the Starfish Story:\r\nhttp://67.199.70.191/articles/the-starfish-story.aspx\r\nHelp us fund loans we're already supporting:\r\nhttp://www.kiva.org/team/late_loaning_lenders/loans?status=fundRaising\r\n\r\n\r\nCheck out Charlotte's Web: http://starfish.dynalias.org\r\n\r\nThis watchlist for loans suggested by the team members (starfish + offlist) shows:\r\n* the current position in the popularity ranking (considering pages 1 to 5)\r\n* the timestamp of the most recent loan\r\n* the basket amount\r\nClick magnifier icon for more info.

                "description": "Alan's account of the founding of LLL is on the  team board @Alan re: #260143. Loans that are nearing expiry won't get funded if they don't get noticed. We look for loans that are about to expire by using the Sort By:\r\n\"Expiring Soon\" option instead of the default \"Popularity\", and then work to get them funded.\r\n\r\nSee our team FAQ, linked above (the \"Team Website\" button, next to our traffic light avatar).\r\n\r\nA Team LLL glossary (contributed by team member Tony):\r\n\r\nRed Loans: Loans that have less than five days to be funded, identifiable by the red box with the notice that says \"Only x days left!\" or \r\n\"Only x hours and y minutes left!\"\r\n\r\nLLL - Late Loaning Lenders: this team, where \r\nlenders work together to keep loans from \r\nexpiring.\r\n\r\nSFDD - Starfish Daily Dozen: Under current \r\npractice, one of these lists is prepared and \r\nposted for each day, to help LLL lenders focus \r\nand coordinate their lending on a targeted \r\ngroup of loans (the Starfish or SF). The lists \r\nare prepared by a group of volunteers who \r\nseek to be objective in selecting the loans to \r\nbe included in their lists. They also seek to \r\nspread out the loans in each list over a 24 hour \r\nperiod and to share the joy among the Field \r\nPartners with loans expiring during that period, \r\nbut their efforts are always constrained by the \r\nchoice of loans that are available for inclusion \r\nin the list. Loans with larger amounts needed \r\nwill be included in the period immediately after \r\neach Credit Day, when lenders are feeling \r\nflush, but the lists will become less ambitious \r\nwhen the LLL lenders are feeling poor.\r\n\r\nGG - Gorgeous Group: The SFDD list-makers usually add one or two of these loans at the end of the SF daily dozen lists. As the name \r\nimplies, only group loans are picked. When it is \r\nfirst posted, a typical GG loan will expire two \r\ndays or more after the list is posted. It will \r\nusually be retained as a GG until it becomes \r\nFully Funded or moves into Starfish range. The amount needed when the loan is selected as a GG will vary depending on the time of month.\r\n\r\nOPM - Abbreviation for \"other people's money.\"  Our main lending method is to coordinate LLL team members' loans, so that we make several loans to a borrower within a short period of time. This will move the borrower's loan request up in Kiva's \"popularity\" sort and get the loan noticed by other people (non-members of the LLL team).  Many loans then get their funding completed by loans from those non-LLL members.  By attracting other lenders' attention to our Starfish loans in this way, we multiply the impact of our finite funds, and save more loans from expiring than we otherwise could.\r\n\r\nRTR - Reduce the Red: These lists are \r\nprepared and posted when there are large \r\nnumbers of loans slated to expire in a short \r\nperiod of time. \"Red\" is a reference to the red \r\nboxes that are added to a loan description \r\nwhen the Loan is about to expire without full \r\nfunding.\r\n\r\nBulge: A short period in which a great many loans have their scheduled funding expiration times. This may happen when, for example, the volunteer coordinators at Kiva offer a promo of some kind to the editors & translators, to get them to do a lot of work in a very short period of time. Bulge loans are prime candidates for inclusion in Reduce the Red lists.\r\n\r\nBTB - Battling the Boxes: On those days where \r\nthere aren't 12 loans that qualify as \"Starfish,\" the listmakers will include loans that have their red boxes, but more than 24 hours left before their deadline, to make up the 12 loans for the list. The criteria are similar to SF \r\nloans, i.e., one per field partner and reasonable \r\namounts left to fund (not too much; not too \r\nlittle), except that these loans may have a longer time left before their expiry date. If they gain good traction on their first BTB day, they may be carried forward. If not ... they stand a second chance as SF.\r\n\r\nFF - Fully Funded: This is LLL code for a loan \r\nthat has received all the loans required for it to be removed from the list of loans that are raising funds \r\nand to move into paying back status.\r\n\r\nLars Ratio: the average funding per hour that is needed for a loan to become fully funded.\r\n(Developed by team member Lars)\r\n\r\nWiedergänger (contributed by Maria) - German expression, literal translation \"again walker,\" meaning \"undead,\" i.e. a person that has died but comes back, aka a zombie. Here it means a loan that disappears from the page, but comes back again because somebody didn't check out their basket.\r\n\r\nRuma sana (contributed by Jouko and Potkukelkka) - Finnish expression, literal translation \"ugly words.\"  It is a phrase to use when you are very frustrated, but want to stop just short of actual cursing -- for example, when the Kiva site repeatedly logs you out when you are trying to rescue an expiring loan at the last second.\r\n\r\nSee data about all loans currently fundraising on Kiva:\r\nwww.kivatools.com\r\nSee data about loans that have been mentioned on the LLL board, including the most recent lending activity on each loan:\r\nhttp://starfish.dynalias.org/\r\nSee loans in real time, as they are made:\r\nhttp://www.http://kivalive.com/index2.php\r\n\r\nLists are posted on the LLL Team message \r\nboard.

Influence our families, friends, community, city, state, nation, and world. If you are not being a spiritual influence, then chances are that you are being influenced spiritually. ",

Through talent and drive, Giro was rapidly promoted up the company ladder to top agent, and eventually Director of Sales. In four months, he managed to guide the company out of the red and expand the operation to over twenty agents. It was during this time that Giro realized his true passion was actually for the investment side of the spectrum–buying, renovating, and selling properties.\r\n\r\nAfter two years of interminable prosperity, Giro departed from Kiska Developers to follow his passion and start his own commercial and residential real estate company, East River Properties. In 1995, he brought his operation to the emerging market in Las Vegas. After several years of success, Giro set his sights on the booming market of Arizona. During these years, Giro’s skill and determination helped him rise to the top of every market he tackled. Giro Katsimbrakis eventually relocated to the Dallas/Fort Worth area, where he founded Distressed Property Wholesalers. He is currently in the process of expanding the operation into markets all over the country.\r\n\r\nGiro has rehabbed over four hundred properties in his career, and has bought and sold millions of dollars of real estate. He is always willing to share his expertise with others in the business to help them become just as wealthy and successful.",

Born into a family with three brothers and three sisters, Paul was steeped in athletic competition from the beginning. Baseball, basketball, soccer; it didn't matter—Paul wanted to compete in any which way. This eventually led him to joining little leagues in several different sports, enjoying varied degrees of success. The pinnacle, perhaps, of his Little League career was when he and his team, the Bethesda Bombers, tallied eight runs in a wild comeback victory, awarding them the championship in the last Little League-eligible game of their careers. His Little League career might have ended, but his competitiveness and love of sports had only just begun.\r\n\r\nNaturally, Paul became an avid fan of all Baltimore sports teams—not just the Orioles and Ravens, but even the Baltimore Blast and now-defunct teams such as the Baltimore Bullets (now the Washington Wizards of the National Basketball Association) and the champion Baltimore Stallions (now the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League). His frequent attendance at these events gave him provided a number of special moments, from meeting Orioles legend Frank Robinson to high-fiving Ravens favorite Ed Reed. \r\n\r\nEventually, Paul Brandley was accepted into the University of Maryland where he pursued a degree in Communications. His four years seemed to be timed perfectly, as he was fortunate enough to be a student during both the 2002 Terrapins Men's NCAA Basketball Championship and in 2006 for the Women's NCAA Basketball Championship. \r\n\r\nWhile working as a budding sports journalist in College Park, Maryland, Paul learned about the challenges faced by inner city children and the difference that sports can make in a child's life. On Kiva, he seeks to support sports programs that provide a much-needed outlet to the children who need it the most. ",

Through his company, Lean Bodies Consulting, Erik has provided individualized bodybuilding, fitness, and nutrition programs to hundreds of clients, tailored to their specific goals, needs, dietary preferences, and lifestyles.

Upon earning his Bachelors of Kinesiology and Bachelors of Education from the University of Windsor, Erik worked as a head nutritionist and strength/conditioning specialist for MuscleTech Research & Development/Iovate Health Sciences. He was also named as the official Mrs. America State Pageant trainer, training twenty state pageant winners for the national competition.\r\n\r\nErik earned his certification as a Personal Trainer (CPT) and a Strength & Conditioning Specialist (CSCS) from the National Strength & Conditioning Association. Additionally, he is also a Certified Kinesiologist from the Ontario Kinesiology Association (OKA), as well as a Certified Sports Nutritionist from the International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN). Erik Ledin is a regularly attendee of the national conferences for NSCA and ISSN. He enjoys converting his education in body science into real life results and measurable success.",

                "description": "Alan's account of the founding of LLL is on the  team board @Alan re: #260143. Loans that are nearing expiry won't get funded if they don't get noticed. We look for loans that are about to expire by using the Sort By:\r\n\"Expiring Soon\" option instead of the default \"Popularity\", and then work to get them funded.\r\n\r\nSee our team FAQ, linked above (the \"Team Website\" button, next to our traffic light avatar).\r\n\r\nA Team LLL glossary (contributed by team member Tony):\r\n\r\nRed Loans: Loans that have less than five days to be funded, identifiable by the red box with the notice that says \"Only x days left!\" or \r\n\"Only x hours and y minutes left!\"\r\n\r\nLLL - Late Loaning Lenders: this team, where \r\nlenders work together to keep loans from \r\nexpiring.\r\n\r\nSFDD - Starfish Daily Dozen: Under current \r\npractice, one of these lists is prepared and \r\nposted for each day, to help LLL lenders focus \r\nand coordinate their lending on a targeted \r\ngroup of loans (the Starfish or SF). The lists \r\nare prepared by a group of volunteers who \r\nseek to be objective in selecting the loans to \r\nbe included in their lists. They also seek to \r\nspread out the loans in each list over a 24 hour \r\nperiod and to share the joy among the Field \r\nPartners with loans expiring during that period, \r\nbut their efforts are always constrained by the \r\nchoice of loans that are available for inclusion \r\nin the list. Loans with larger amounts needed \r\nwill be included in the period immediately after \r\neach Credit Day, when lenders are feeling \r\nflush, but the lists will become less ambitious \r\nwhen the LLL lenders are feeling poor.\r\n\r\nGG - Gorgeous Group: The SFDD list-makers usually add one or two of these loans at the end of the SF daily dozen lists. As the name \r\nimplies, only group loans are picked. When it is \r\nfirst posted, a typical GG loan will expire two \r\ndays or more after the list is posted. It will \r\nusually be retained as a GG until it becomes \r\nFully Funded or moves into Starfish range. The amount needed when the loan is selected as a GG will vary depending on the time of month.\r\n\r\nOPM - Abbreviation for \"other people's money.\"  Our main lending method is to coordinate LLL team members' loans, so that we make several loans to a borrower within a short period of time. This will move the borrower's loan request up in Kiva's \"popularity\" sort and get the loan noticed by other people (non-members of the LLL team).  Many loans then get their funding completed by loans from those non-LLL members.  By attracting other lenders' attention to our Starfish loans in this way, we multiply the impact of our finite funds, and save more loans from expiring than we otherwise could.\r\n\r\nRTR - Reduce the Red: These lists are \r\nprepared and posted when there are large \r\nnumbers of loans slated to expire in a short \r\nperiod of time. \"Red\" is a reference to the red \r\nboxes that are added to a loan description \r\nwhen the Loan is about to expire without full \r\nfunding.\r\n\r\nBulge: A short period in which a great many loans have their scheduled funding expiration times. This may happen when, for example, the volunteer coordinators at Kiva offer a promo of some kind to the editors & translators, to get them to do a lot of work in a very short period of time. Bulge loans are prime candidates for inclusion in Reduce the Red lists.\r\n\r\nBTB - Battling the Boxes: On those days where \r\nthere aren't 12 loans that qualify as \"Starfish,\" the listmakers will include loans that have their red boxes, but more than 24 hours left before their deadline, to make up the 12 loans for the list. The criteria are similar to SF \r\nloans, i.e., one per field partner and reasonable \r\namounts left to fund (not too much; not too \r\nlittle), except that these loans may have a longer time left before their expiry date. If they gain good traction on their first BTB day, they may be carried forward. If not ... they stand a second chance as SF.\r\n\r\nFF - Fully Funded: This is LLL code for a loan \r\nthat has received all the loans required for it to be removed from the list of loans that are raising funds \r\nand to move into paying back status.\r\n\r\nLars Ratio: the average funding per hour that is needed for a loan to become fully funded.\r\n(Developed by team member Lars)\r\n\r\nWiedergänger (contributed by Maria) - German expression, literal translation \"again walker,\" meaning \"undead,\" i.e. a person that has died but comes back, aka a zombie. Here it means a loan that disappears from the page, but comes back again because somebody didn't check out their basket.\r\n\r\nRuma sana (contributed by Jouko and Potkukelkka) - Finnish expression, literal translation \"ugly words.\"  It is a phrase to use when you are very frustrated, but want to stop just short of actual cursing -- for example, when the Kiva site repeatedly logs you out when you are trying to rescue an expiring loan at the last second.\r\n\r\nSee data about all loans currently fundraising on Kiva:\r\nwww.kivatools.com\r\nSee data about loans that have been mentioned on the LLL board, including the most recent lending activity on each loan:\r\nhttp://starfish.dynalias.org/\r\nSee loans in real time, as they are made:\r\nhttp://www.http://kivalive.com/index2.php\r\n\r\nLists are posted on the LLL Team message \r\nboard.

                "description": "In our team, we have a vision to change lives in novel ways. Our team's origin began with a Kiva Card (gift certificate) whose recipient founded this team. Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

His skills as a businessman were apparent early on in his career, as he proved to be talented as a marketer and force in driving company revenue upwards.  He was quick to scale the ladder of a large non-profit organization where he got his first job, going from Graphic Designer to Director of Media rapidly, shortly after becoming the Executive Vice President.  In this prestigious position, Brandon developed and implemented various strategic plans for boosting the company, which ultimately were extremely successful.\r\n\r\nIn his fast-paced first employment, Brandon Vallorani was simultaneously earning his MBA at Thomas More College, specifically focused on business management.  After completing this degree in 2004, that same year he moved to the south, where he became the Executive Vice President of a non-profit company, which he built up by just about 600% in less than four years.\r\n\r\nBrandon's talents in the business world continued to grow through various business pursuits until ultimately he came to form Liberty Alliance, a company that \"represents a network of websites dedicated to advancing Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. Our members and strategic partners leverage the power of new media to promote traditional values and generate more than 1,000,000 page views each day.\"\r\n\r\nBrandon Vallorani prides himself on building his business and making it a wonderful place for his employees to work, but he also takes pride in his pursuits outside of the office as well.  One of Brandon's favorite hobbies is hunting big-game and he often can be found practicing his marksmanship at the Governor's Gun Club in Powder Springs, Georgia. Brandon is also passionate about his interests in fine wines and fine cigars.  He owns and co-founded his own fine cigar distribution company, called Safari Cigar, and he owns his own vineyard, Vallorani Vineyards.   On top of being a successful entrepreneur, an avid pursuer of adventure hobbies and a fine wine/cigar aficionado, Brandon Vallorani above all enjoys spending time with his wife and 7 children, as well as with close friends.",

I had always been a big fan of the Chicago Bulls and couldn’t help but watch every game when Michael Jordan was a member of the team. Jordan had a knack for taking that last big shot in the waning seconds of the game. He thrived under pressure and always wanted to be the one who beat the other team with his end of game heroics.\r\n\r\nThe number 3126711996 not only holds a near and dear place in my heart for where I grew up in Chicago, Illinois, but it’s also my lucky winning number. 3126711996 is my go to number when it comes to any lottery game and I have been lucky to win some money along the way. Everyone has their personal numbers that they will play or use for different circumstances. When it comes to the lottery, 3126711996 is my number. It has always been and will be forever.\r\n\r\nPeople can be very superstitious when it comes to numbers. Numbers to me are just digits that follow one another in no sequential order whatsoever. 3126711996 might be my childhood phone number, a number for many that bears little meaning latter in life, but for me it sticks with me everyday. Nowadays, people don’t think of landline phone numbers anymore and they are becoming more and more caught up with mobile cell phones. I remember when I had to reach my parents, the only way I could was to call 3126711996 - my home phone. It’s crazy to think how far we’ve come from landline to mobile cell phones. I would think new home owners might shy away from putting in a landline. Is it truly necessary? Couldn’t a mobile phone suffice? More often than not, people take their calls on cell phones, so I could see why people might not need a landline phone.\r\n\r\n3126711996 is a number that I will continue to use in certain situations and I don’t think I will ever forget it. The number brings back a lot of great memories and I’m sure it will only continue to provide more in the future. ",
