Gardeners think, plan, and act to influence strongly. That's why we are committed to help others to help themselves. - The Gardeners",

He was previously Director of Genomics and Bioinformatics for Cardiome Pharma Corporation, and was previously co-founder and Vice President of Cardiovascular Biology of Artesian Therapeutics, Inc., which was acquired by Cardiome in 2005. He has served as a consultant for Cardiome for two years and was subsequently hired in 2007 to develop genomic and proteomic biomarker programs to help augment and accelerate clinical trial design. The primary translational derivative for Cardiome was creating the largest known cardiovascular gene expression database for Gene Logic.  Daniel Bednarik also served as a key scientist for the development of Human Genome Sciences’ (HGS) database and has over 28+ years experience in the field of virology with emphasis on HIV and herpes virus pathophysiology.  He was co-recipient of a DARPA contract in 2006 where he and his colleagues developed a novel non-host method for rapid vaccine manufacture and deployment. Daniel Bednarik is very experienced in developing and managing clinical programs.  His training was completed at Temple University School of Medicine (Philadelphia) in 1985, and The Johns Hopkins University Oncology Center (Baltimore).\r\n\r\nDaniel Bednarik is very comfortable with both theory and application at the bench. On top of this foundation,  he has a deeply rooted enthusiasm and curiosity about new technologies and biological discoveries that I try to expand upon from my knowledge base relevant to biotechnology and scientific discovery tools and the commercial and therapeutic opportunities they offer.  Although Daniel is neither a physician nor a physiologist, he likes to seek out, absorb and integrate expert opinions in these and other key areas, being that he is a focused listener and a very quick study.  He strongly believes this method reinforces conception of creative ideas for both technical and experimental problem solving and for identifying new targets for experimental inquiry and potential commercialization.  Daniel is proactive and effective in facilitating interactions with industrial contacts that have benefited his collaborator’s laboratories programmatically in one way or another, and proactively tries to mesh his background and knowledge to complement those of the groups he collaborates with.  His prior and current collaborative relationships remain grounded in shared discovery goals, mutual benefit, and mutual trust derived from sustained and effective professional interactions.  As a result, Daniel Bednarik is delighted to engage in ventures that exploit these kinds of relationships while allowing these efforts to work together towards mutual scientific/therapeutic goals.",

                "loan_because": "Greg Limeberry of Salt Lake City, Utah, is a ski patrolman at Snowbird mountain.  He grew up in New Hartford, New York, playing hockey and skiing, continuing to do both through college.  After college, he moved out west to continue skiing and think more about what he wanted to do with his life.  He took a job as a ski lift attendant to make some money while he pondered his future, but instead he fell in love with the mountain, and never left.  Wanting to ski more, he took the training course to become a ski patrolman, and now can be found on the slopes of snowbird, rescuing skiers and keeping the mountain safe.  His job is his passion and he wouldn’t want to be doing anything else.\r\n\r\nWhen Greg Limeberry isn’t skiing, he’s planning his next adventure trip.  He loves to travel, especially trips that involve adventure.  He has climbed Mt. McKinley in Alaska, hiked the Zion Narrows of Utah and backpacked the extensive trails of Glacier National Park in Montana, to name a few.  Greg Limeberry hopes to travel more within the USA, and perhaps take his adventurous spirit overseas to explore more of the world.  Greg Lives with his wife Angela and two bernese mountain dogs, Ella and Bear.",

This was followed with medical training at the Ohio College of Podiatric Medicine, where Marc Blatstein obtained a Doctor of Podiatric Medicine Degree. While he was here, he also worked to help with the costs of an education.  Marc had a surgical residency in Podiatric Medicine, which followed by a 22 year career as a single practitioner. While in practice he incorporated a medically oriented shoe store, wound care and physical therapy. A major part of Marc Blatstein’s practice is the use of The Circulator Boot™ as a method of treatment that supports the core elements of wound therapy: increased blood supply, bacterial control, moisture and debridement. Along with other modes of treatment, surgical debridement of infected wounds, the use of antibiotic medications, along with home care, boot therapy may improve the blood supply and control the infection in necrotizing cellulitis when standard methods of treatment are failing.",

It is the forum where the villagers are making world wide contacts by hosting guests freely and exchanging cultural values. Our home stay programme have opened doors with contacts from all continents and in return some of our guests have participated in funding some of the community projects.\r\n\r\nFurthermore we lobby for the african childhood who stay in the village and fight difficulties meeting their daily needs due to a certain disadvantage; for instance: if the child had lost one or both parents due to H.I.V./Aids or if the parents are too poor to afford offering the child the basic needs and education. Our popular programme called Omega Child is the core for formula for success and in order to support African Child in this programme we conduce long distance adoptions, talent search, placement at a children home, and other initiatives.\r\n\r\nOur core values are networking and collaboration as a basis for acquiring and sharing cultural diversity. We advocate for community participation and resource mobilization, planning, monitoring and evaluation of the projects for the benefit of the community and the funding agents.\r\n\r\nWe indeed collaborate with young people, parents, teachers, professionals, community leaders and others the effort to empower young people and promote their contribution in the community around the issues of familiar planning, health, H.I.V./Aids, environment conservation, leadership, and any other key inter-related socioeconomic affairs. There are affiliated projects in the slums as some of those young people living in the village come to the city after school, in search of jobs hence having a new home in the slum after failing to secure any job in the city. At the moment we are encouraging them to come back to the village and help in mobilizing the available resources and participate within the project.\r\n\r\nIn summary, African child initiative has 4 key areas of intervention in the village:\r\n\r\n    * Poverty eradication\r\n    * Entrepreneurship encouraging\r\n    * Community development\r\n    * Education and learning with special emphasis in computer literacy\r\n\r\nWe identify critical issues that concern this villages, slums, and community and translate them into short term and long term programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR MISSION\r\n\r\nTo approach community development from the grass roots.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR VISION\r\n\r\nTo advocate for self and community empowerment.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can you be of help to our initiative?\r\n\r\n    *\r\n\r\n      You can make any form of contribution (materials, cash, skills and ideas) towards any of our numerous projects.\r\n    *\r\n\r\n      You can be part of the network, campaign or volunteer to work with one or any of our projects.\r\n    *\r\n\r\n      Be part of our cultural ambassadors by visiting our village and joining our cultural exchange programme.\r\n\r\n\r\nThadeus M.

DoSomething.org spearheads national campaigns so 13- to 25-year-olds can make an impact - without ever needing money, an adult, or a car. Over 2.4 million people took action through DoSomething.org in 2012. Why? Because apathy sucks.",
