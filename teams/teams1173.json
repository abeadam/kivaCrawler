We believe that \r\nthis will damage the Field Partners in the long \r\nterm and impair their capacity to make loans to new borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe can't save every red loan, but we try to\r\nmake a difference as in the Starfish Story:\r\nhttp://67.199.70.191/articles/the-starfish-story.aspx\r\nHelp us fund loans we're already supporting:\r\nhttp://www.kiva.org/team/late_loaning_lenders/loans?status=fundRaising\r\n\r\n\r\nCheck out Charlotte's Web: http://starfish.dynalias.org\r\n\r\nThis watchlist for loans suggested by the team members (starfish + offlist) shows:\r\n* the current position in the popularity ranking (considering pages 1 to 5)\r\n* the timestamp of the most recent loan\r\n* the basket amount\r\nClick magnifier icon for more info.

                "description": "Alan's account of the founding of LLL is on the  team board @Alan re: #260143. Loans that are nearing expiry won't get funded if they don't get noticed. We look for loans that are about to expire by using the Sort By:\r\n\"Expiring Soon\" option instead of the default \"Popularity\", and then work to get them funded.\r\n\r\nSee our team FAQ, linked above (the \"Team Website\" button, next to our traffic light avatar).\r\n\r\nA Team LLL glossary (contributed by team member Tony):\r\n\r\nRed Loans: Loans that have less than five days to be funded, identifiable by the red box with the notice that says \"Only x days left!\" or \r\n\"Only x hours and y minutes left!\"\r\n\r\nLLL - Late Loaning Lenders: this team, where \r\nlenders work together to keep loans from \r\nexpiring.\r\n\r\nSFDD - Starfish Daily Dozen: Under current \r\npractice, one of these lists is prepared and \r\nposted for each day, to help LLL lenders focus \r\nand coordinate their lending on a targeted \r\ngroup of loans (the Starfish or SF). The lists \r\nare prepared by a group of volunteers who \r\nseek to be objective in selecting the loans to \r\nbe included in their lists. They also seek to \r\nspread out the loans in each list over a 24 hour \r\nperiod and to share the joy among the Field \r\nPartners with loans expiring during that period, \r\nbut their efforts are always constrained by the \r\nchoice of loans that are available for inclusion \r\nin the list. Loans with larger amounts needed \r\nwill be included in the period immediately after \r\neach Credit Day, when lenders are feeling \r\nflush, but the lists will become less ambitious \r\nwhen the LLL lenders are feeling poor.\r\n\r\nGG - Gorgeous Group: The SFDD list-makers usually add one or two of these loans at the end of the SF daily dozen lists. As the name \r\nimplies, only group loans are picked. When it is \r\nfirst posted, a typical GG loan will expire two \r\ndays or more after the list is posted. It will \r\nusually be retained as a GG until it becomes \r\nFully Funded or moves into Starfish range. The amount needed when the loan is selected as a GG will vary depending on the time of month.\r\n\r\nOPM - Abbreviation for \"other people's money.\"  Our main lending method is to coordinate LLL team members' loans, so that we make several loans to a borrower within a short period of time. This will move the borrower's loan request up in Kiva's \"popularity\" sort and get the loan noticed by other people (non-members of the LLL team).  Many loans then get their funding completed by loans from those non-LLL members.  By attracting other lenders' attention to our Starfish loans in this way, we multiply the impact of our finite funds, and save more loans from expiring than we otherwise could.\r\n\r\nRTR - Reduce the Red: These lists are \r\nprepared and posted when there are large \r\nnumbers of loans slated to expire in a short \r\nperiod of time. \"Red\" is a reference to the red \r\nboxes that are added to a loan description \r\nwhen the Loan is about to expire without full \r\nfunding.\r\n\r\nBulge: A short period in which a great many loans have their scheduled funding expiration times. This may happen when, for example, the volunteer coordinators at Kiva offer a promo of some kind to the editors & translators, to get them to do a lot of work in a very short period of time. Bulge loans are prime candidates for inclusion in Reduce the Red lists.\r\n\r\nBTB - Battling the Boxes: On those days where \r\nthere aren't 12 loans that qualify as \"Starfish,\" the listmakers will include loans that have their red boxes, but more than 24 hours left before their deadline, to make up the 12 loans for the list. The criteria are similar to SF \r\nloans, i.e., one per field partner and reasonable \r\namounts left to fund (not too much; not too \r\nlittle), except that these loans may have a longer time left before their expiry date. If they gain good traction on their first BTB day, they may be carried forward. If not ... they stand a second chance as SF.\r\n\r\nFF - Fully Funded: This is LLL code for a loan \r\nthat has received all the loans required for it to be removed from the list of loans that are raising funds \r\nand to move into paying back status.\r\n\r\nLars Ratio: the average funding per hour that is needed for a loan to become fully funded.\r\n(Developed by team member Lars)\r\n\r\nWiedergänger (contributed by Maria) - German expression, literal translation \"again walker,\" meaning \"undead,\" i.e. a person that has died but comes back, aka a zombie. Here it means a loan that disappears from the page, but comes back again because somebody didn't check out their basket.\r\n\r\nRuma sana (contributed by Jouko and Potkukelkka) - Finnish expression, literal translation \"ugly words.\"  It is a phrase to use when you are very frustrated, but want to stop just short of actual cursing -- for example, when the Kiva site repeatedly logs you out when you are trying to rescue an expiring loan at the last second.\r\n\r\nSee data about all loans currently fundraising on Kiva:\r\nwww.kivatools.com\r\nSee data about loans that have been mentioned on the LLL board, including the most recent lending activity on each loan:\r\nhttp://starfish.dynalias.org/\r\nSee loans in real time, as they are made:\r\nhttp://www.http://kivalive.com/index2.php\r\n\r\nLists are posted on the LLL Team message \r\nboard.

We received photos of candles from around the world, which provided comfort. This Kiva lending team is a virtual candle we're lighting in memory of great dads everywhere - their light and love will live on.\r\n\r\n...................\r\n\r\nHOW TO LOAN WITH OUR KIVA TEAM:\r\n\r\n1. Join Kiva, then join our \"Candles for Dads\" Lending Team.\r\n2. After you've joined our Lending Team, find a dad on Kiva to loan to and make a loan of $25 or more.\r\n3. During checkout, select to have your loan count towards our \"Candles for Dads\" Kiva Team's collective impact. Thanks!\r\n\r\nHOW TO FIND DADS ON KIVA TO LOAN TO:\r\n1. Find a Featured Candles for Dads loan on our Team Activity page, or on our Facebook page: www.facebook.com/candlesfordads\r\n2. Search for new dads to support on Kiva by clicking \"Lend\" in the Kiva main menu, then filter your search by gender and read profiles to find dads to loan to. Share your finds with us on facebook so we chip in as a group (we're still a small group, so plan to feature 1-2 loans a month for now). \r\n...................\r\n\r\nHELP SHARE CANDLES FOR DADS:\r\n1. Please connect with us on Facebook & Twitter and invite friends to join us:\r\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/candlesfordads\r\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/candlesfordads\r\nWebsite: http://candlesfordads.org (forwards to Kiva Team Page)\r\n2. Recruit friends to join our Kiva Lending Team. Kiva has some cool recruiting tools that (sometimes) even give you and friends who join a $25 credit to make loans when they join: http://www.kiva.org/team/CandlesForDads/recruit \r\n3. Volunteer Research for Dad Loan Suggestions: If you find a great dad on Kiva for us to loan to, share the Kiva profiles on our facebook page so others on our team can chip in to reach the goal. We will feature at least one C4D loan each month.\r\n4. Share a memory of a great dad you are donating in memory of on our facebook and twitter.\r\n......................\r\n\r\nIn memory of our dad, Shaman Mullick (1947 - 2012), and great dads everywhere. Your love and light live on. ",

She has dedicated her time and energy over the years to help the youth of America through teaching and coaching. Jamie attended both public and private schools throughout her adolescence. She later moved to Claremont, CA to obtain her undergrad at Pitzer College. Jamie certainly kept busy; she not only played lacrosse, but also participated in a number of service learning projects and internships.  Highlights include her work with the LAPD’s Youth Gang Unit program, a social justice project with the Asian American Resource Center at Pomona College, and the mentorship of local Pomona community teenagers.  She graduated from Pitzer with B.A.’s in Psychology and Asian American Studies.  Jamie later moved to Chicago, where she taught 6th grade at Victor Herbert Elementary School.  She also earned her teaching certificate at National Louis University and started a high school girl’s lacrosse team at Northside College Prep High School.  Jamie eventually returned to Seattle upon her acceptance of a new teaching position at Meany Middle School. Meanwhile, she coached soccer, basketball, and lacrosse at Lakeside Middle School during her downtime.  Jamie selflessly dedicated several summers to the Lakeside Educational Enrichment Program (LEEP), and for the past 11 years has worked at Lakeside School in various capacities:  Teacher, Student Life Department Head, Family and Student Support, and currently, Middle School Assistant Director.  Throughout her years at Lakeside, she also earned a Master’s degree in Education Administration from Seattle University and a Master’s in Social Work from the University of Washington.  In her free time, Jamie enjoys coaching high school girl’s lacrosse, in addition to her club lacrosse program, Puget Sound Select.  ",

                "loan_because": "Barry Oberholzer lived for the first few years of his life in Houston, Texas. He is a brother to three other siblings and is a son of Diplomatic Parents.  After spending some time in Houston, Barry Oberholzer and his family moved back to South Africa. He began pre school in the charming coastal township of George, South Africa. He didn’t stay long though, as his dad was transferred again and they ended up living in Cape Town, South Africa.\r\n\r\nBarry Oberholzer started his twelve year schooling career at Welgemoed Primary School where he stayed until after seventh grade. After Welgemoed, Barry attended Paul Roos Gymnasium, one of the best all boys schools in the world.\r\n\r\nDuring grades eight to twelve, Barry Oberholzer had some of the most memorable times of his life both on and off the rugby field. He was no different than other boys at that age, having his fair share of general mischief, and in turn learned the fundamental principles of life. After High School Barry Oberholzer decided to take a gap year to play rugby abroad and later came back in 2002 to attend the University of South Africa where he received his Bachelors Degree in Marketing.\r\n\r\nAt age 15, Barry’s first job was a lifeguard. At that point of your life all that matters during summer holidays are girls and pocket money and lifeguarding seemed to mesh both of those things perfectly. Barry Oberholzer spent five summers lifeguarding at different beaches around the Western Cape, keeping him fit and healthy.\r\n\r\nAfter school and taking a gap year, it was time for Barry to find a real job. God knows how he ended up in aviation but somehow he did and his first salary based work opportunity was at Base 4 Aviation as a Marketing Manager, a helicopter company located in Cape Town.\r\n\r\nBarry Oberholzer later began to broker helicopter sales and a sales division was started. After working for some time at Base 4 Aviation, Barry felt he needed to explore his own opportunities and started two other aviation companies, PEH and 360 Aviation. PEH first started in 2005 and 360 Aviation in 2007.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Barry is a full-time independent contractor for a Cyprus based company in brand integrity and aviation. Barry is an Ironman triathlete having competed in both the Ironman 70.3 South Africa and Ironman Nelson Mandela Bay. His next ambition is qualifying for Kona by age 35.",

Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.
