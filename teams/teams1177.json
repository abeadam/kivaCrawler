McGivney, assistant pastor of St. Mary’s Church in New Haven and some of his parishioners, the Connecticut state legislature on March 29, 1882, officially chartered the Knights of Columbus as a fraternal benefit society. The Order is still true to its founding principles of charity, unity and fraternity.\r\n\r\nThe Knights was formed to render financial aid to members and their families. Mutual aid and assistance are offered to sick, disabled and needy members and their families. Social and intellectual fellowship is promoted among members and their families through educational, charitable, religious, social welfare, war relief and public relief works.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Order shows how the foresight of Father Michael J. McGivney, whose cause for sainthood is being investigated by the Vatican, brought about what has become the world's foremost Catholic fraternal benefit society. The Order has helped families obtain economic security and stability through its life insurance, annuity and long-term care programs, and has contributed time and energy worldwide to service in communities.\r\n\r\nThe Knights of Columbus has grown from several members in one council to more than 13,000 councils and 1.7 million members throughout the United States, Canada, the Philippines, Mexico, Poland, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Panama, the Bahamas, the Virgin Islands, Cuba, Guatemala, Guam and Saipan.\r\n",

In high school, David and his debate partner had the distinguished honor of being National High School debate champions. He witnessed first hand the inner workings of our government by attending congressional hearings. David was also selected for an internship at the United States Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nThroughout his college years, David became very active in student government and residential life. He spoke out for the weak and underprivileged. He never compromised his values in the face of adversity. He fought for what he believed and he never backed down.\r\n\r\nAt Duke University School of Law, David continued to hone his persuasive skills. During his first year, he “booked” his property law and criminal law classes. This distinguished honor recognized David for the student with the highest score in the class. David flourished in trial advocacy. In the end, David received the most distinguished honor bestowed upon a graduating law student, The Order of the Coif. This award is reserved for the TOP 5% of any graduating class.\r\n\r\nToday, criminal defense attorney David Coolidge uses his years of training and experience to defend people at their most vulnerable moment. Being charged with a criminal offense can have devastating impact for not only the accused but their entire family. David understands this and makes himself available 24/7, 365 days/year to his clients. He gives each of his clients his cell phone so that they reach him at any moment. David’s clients know that even on Christmas day, David will take their call if it’s an emergency.\r\n\r\nAttorney David Coolidge prides himself on delivering competent, professional, and compassionate legal representation. He considers it an honor for a client to entrust him with their legal defense. David is a tough negotiator who is not afraid of challenging the district attorney. He’s a zealous advocator. David refers to himself as a trial attorney. He can negotiate with the best of them but the other side knows that he will be formidable opponent should the case be ultimately tried in a criminal courtroom.\r\n\r\nOutside of the courtroom, David maintains active membership in the NC Bar Association, Wake County Bar Association, NC Advocates for Justice and the Wake County Academy of Criminal Trial Lawyers. David also has been asked to conduct continuing legal education classes for other lawyers by the North Carolina Advocates for Justice.",

We have no religious, racial or political affiliations of any kind. We want to encourage sustainable enterprises that recycle, reuse, repurpose and use environmentally sound agricultural and manufacturing practices. \r\nMany of us would like Kiva to develop environmental standards or criteria for their lending practices to prevent environmental impacts that would increase poverty for future generations.\r\nMany people want to have a green portfolio, or at least a green component. \r\nWon't you join us in creating true sustainability that includes a healthy environment?",

Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

If you think a poem is worth 85 cents, then in a month you will have received 25 dollars worth of words.  Please choose a Kiva effort to support with a twenty-five dollar micro loan.  The best news is that your money will hopefully be repaid to you and, with your dividend, you can support a new KIVA effort.  I've started with the first loan.  You can follow suit.  So many of you have thanked me for my poems when I did Advent or Lenten stretches.  Let's turn our thanks into a tangible form of giving and grace. 30 poems in 30 days for 25 dollars.  A bargain.  A way to change someone's life. ",
