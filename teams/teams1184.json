He received his undergraduate and postgraduate Law degrees from the University of Sheffield and University College, respectively. Chris’s career began as a barrister, where he undertook courtroom advocacy, wrote advice and opinions, and drafted legal documents pertaining to a wide variety of areas, including commercial, criminal, personal, family, immigration, clinical injury, and company law.\r\n\r\nAfter a busy pupilage, Chris worked for a plethora of law firms specializing in insurance and commercial litigation around London. His duties included drafting and advising insurance policy wordings, handling defense and insurance coverage litigation, and advising on general commercial litigation issues. He then spent a year on secondment to one of London’s big four accountancy firms, where he advised on global contracts,  B2B contracts (for supply of services), engagement agreements, secondment and consultancy agreements, and various in-house matters like employment, pensions, health and safety, and corruption and anti-bribery.\r\n\r\nSince January of 2012, Chris Wakem has provide advice in a wide array of matters, both contentious and non-contentious, through his company Lightbringer Solutions Ltd. He has helped companies large and small establish risk management policies, develop start-up procedures, negotiate framework agreements, secure insurance coverage, and deal with Anti-Money-Laundering and Anti-Bribery and corruption matters. In addition, he has assisted organizations with litigation relating to the miss-selling of derivative financial products, global compliance issues, inter-bank lending matters, and global AML/CFT matters. He has increasingly devoted his attention to these financial services–particularly AML / CTF / ABC matters–given the sharp increase in regulatory activity in those areas.\r\n\r\nIn his free time, Chris immerses himself in all things rugby and cricket, and just recently fell in love with George RR Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire series.",
