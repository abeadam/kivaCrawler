At High-Impact Loan Lenders, we are interested in the very best loans.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to define an exact criteria for the loans in which we are interested, but there will not be very many of them. We look for loans that practically make us jump out of our chair and exclaim \"Holy cow! What a great loan!\" If a loan is so good that it makes you say \"Forget about the budget -- I have 25 bucks for THAT loan!\" it is a loan in which we would be interested. Looking at the loans that we've supported will give you an idea of the loans that we like.",

Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.
