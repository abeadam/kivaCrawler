Having all loans reviewed and tagged to the same standards will enable lenders to find loans they are interested in faster, and can help to get loans funded before they expire.\r\n\r\nCurrent tagging status: docs.google.com/spreadsheet\r\ndocs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AkRBX8P18KLadHY0UllxZ3ljT2E2dlBYRXpEd3Blemc&usp=sharing",

You can also sign up for Clean up Crew (loans closest to expiration, all sectors).\r\n3) The number of loans you want to tag (30 or more. With a little practice you can tag 1 loan per minute, so 30 loans = 30 min).\r\n4) Join the team and post your picks on the message board: \"Saturday / Food / 30 loans\"\r\n5) Check the team board and your personal message folder the next Saturday for a list of 30 loans to be tagged.",
