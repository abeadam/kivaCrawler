We want to help get them funded by organizing a Flash Mob to these loans.  \r\n\r\nThe effect of many lenders loaning to the same loan at the same time is that the loan will show up on page 1 of the popularity sort, which is the default page that most lenders look at when they come to Kiva. So besides the loans from the Flash Mob team, Flash Mob loans often attract many additional loans from other lenders who just happened to log into Kiva at this time. Sometimes a loan gets completely funded within the hour!\r\n\r\nFeel free to keep attributing your loans to your favorite team, it is fun to see many different team logos on the same loan.\r\n\r\n",

For maximum Flash Mob impact, please try to loan exactly at Flash Mob time.\r\n\r\nFor email alerts with just the daily loan link, please join http://www.kiva.org/team/KFM_messages and set your email preferences for that team to immediate delivery.
