As Wikipedia explains, \"The motto is derived from a sentence in Cicero's most influential philosophical work, his treatise On Duties (Latin: De Officiis). In full, Cicero writes, non nobis solum nati sumus ortusque nostri partem patria vindicat, partem amici (\"Not for us alone are we born; our country, our friends, have a share in us\"), Cicero, de officiis, 1:22. The sentence, as Cicero himself says, is a literal translation of a sentiment from Plato's Letter to Archytas.[1] In the context of the passage, the sentence means that \"humans have been created for the sake of others of their kind, indeed, to benefit each other as much as possible\".[2] Cicero associates this concept with the Stoic ideal of cosmopolitanism, according to which all men have a natural kinship with all other men and need to \"contribute to the general good by an interchange of acts of kindness (officia), by giving and receiving\"[3]\"",
