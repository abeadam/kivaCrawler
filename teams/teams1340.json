The family lives on the Big Island and her treatment is on Oahu.\r\nive year old Faith was diagnosed with Leukemia and the news comes almost one year to the date Faithy's Auntie Nohea passed away from Breast Cancer. This is a devastating blow but her name says it all - we have FAITH she will beat this. In addition to this challenge the family lives on the Big Island of Hawaii and her treating physician's are on Oahu. Medical coverage it handles only 90% and in addition to the 10% financial burden the family has to factor in airfare and lodging for each medical treatment and specialist appointment. Neav McAlister is one of my oldest, and dearest friends. My family. Neav and Greta share godmother responsibilities to my oldest son, Alex and Greta and I share Faith as a goddaughter. Neav and Rafer welcomed Faith in 2008 and it was the best day ever! Faith has an older brother and sister, Grace and Levi who live on the mainland and just left after their annual two month summer visit. Faith is a little spitfire of energy who recently celebrated her birthday (8/14) and started kindergarten. She is a true Hawaiian girl with a little accent, saying \"yeah?\" after every sentence!

                "description": "Alan's account of the founding of LLL is on the  team board @Alan re: #260143. Loans that are nearing expiry won't get funded if they don't get noticed. We look for loans that are about to expire by using the Sort By:\r\n\"Expiring Soon\" option instead of the default \"Popularity\", and then work to get them funded.\r\n\r\nSee our team FAQ, linked above (the \"Team Website\" button, next to our traffic light avatar).\r\n\r\nA Team LLL glossary (contributed by team member Tony):\r\n\r\nRed Loans: Loans that have less than five days to be funded, identifiable by the red box with the notice that says \"Only x days left!\" or \r\n\"Only x hours and y minutes left!\"\r\n\r\nLLL - Late Loaning Lenders: this team, where \r\nlenders work together to keep loans from \r\nexpiring.\r\n\r\nSFDD - Starfish Daily Dozen: Under current \r\npractice, one of these lists is prepared and \r\nposted for each day, to help LLL lenders focus \r\nand coordinate their lending on a targeted \r\ngroup of loans (the Starfish or SF). The lists \r\nare prepared by a group of volunteers who \r\nseek to be objective in selecting the loans to \r\nbe included in their lists. They also seek to \r\nspread out the loans in each list over a 24 hour \r\nperiod and to share the joy among the Field \r\nPartners with loans expiring during that period, \r\nbut their efforts are always constrained by the \r\nchoice of loans that are available for inclusion \r\nin the list. Loans with larger amounts needed \r\nwill be included in the period immediately after \r\neach Credit Day, when lenders are feeling \r\nflush, but the lists will become less ambitious \r\nwhen the LLL lenders are feeling poor.\r\n\r\nGG - Gorgeous Group: The SFDD list-makers usually add one or two of these loans at the end of the SF daily dozen lists. As the name \r\nimplies, only group loans are picked. When it is \r\nfirst posted, a typical GG loan will expire two \r\ndays or more after the list is posted. It will \r\nusually be retained as a GG until it becomes \r\nFully Funded or moves into Starfish range. The amount needed when the loan is selected as a GG will vary depending on the time of month.\r\n\r\nOPM - Abbreviation for \"other people's money.\"  Our main lending method is to coordinate LLL team members' loans, so that we make several loans to a borrower within a short period of time. This will move the borrower's loan request up in Kiva's \"popularity\" sort and get the loan noticed by other people (non-members of the LLL team).  Many loans then get their funding completed by loans from those non-LLL members.  By attracting other lenders' attention to our Starfish loans in this way, we multiply the impact of our finite funds, and save more loans from expiring than we otherwise could.\r\n\r\nRTR - Reduce the Red: These lists are \r\nprepared and posted when there are large \r\nnumbers of loans slated to expire in a short \r\nperiod of time. \"Red\" is a reference to the red \r\nboxes that are added to a loan description \r\nwhen the Loan is about to expire without full \r\nfunding.\r\n\r\nBulge: A short period in which a great many loans have their scheduled funding expiration times. This may happen when, for example, the volunteer coordinators at Kiva offer a promo of some kind to the editors & translators, to get them to do a lot of work in a very short period of time. Bulge loans are prime candidates for inclusion in Reduce the Red lists.\r\n\r\nBTB - Battling the Boxes: On those days where \r\nthere aren't 12 loans that qualify as \"Starfish,\" the listmakers will include loans that have their red boxes, but more than 24 hours left before their deadline, to make up the 12 loans for the list. The criteria are similar to SF \r\nloans, i.e., one per field partner and reasonable \r\namounts left to fund (not too much; not too \r\nlittle), except that these loans may have a longer time left before their expiry date. If they gain good traction on their first BTB day, they may be carried forward. If not ... they stand a second chance as SF.\r\n\r\nFF - Fully Funded: This is LLL code for a loan \r\nthat has received all the loans required for it to be removed from the list of loans that are raising funds \r\nand to move into paying back status.\r\n\r\nLars Ratio: the average funding per hour that is needed for a loan to become fully funded.\r\n(Developed by team member Lars)\r\n\r\nWiedergänger (contributed by Maria) - German expression, literal translation \"again walker,\" meaning \"undead,\" i.e. a person that has died but comes back, aka a zombie. Here it means a loan that disappears from the page, but comes back again because somebody didn't check out their basket.\r\n\r\nRuma sana (contributed by Jouko and Potkukelkka) - Finnish expression, literal translation \"ugly words.\"  It is a phrase to use when you are very frustrated, but want to stop just short of actual cursing -- for example, when the Kiva site repeatedly logs you out when you are trying to rescue an expiring loan at the last second.\r\n\r\nSee data about all loans currently fundraising on Kiva:\r\nwww.kivatools.com\r\nSee data about loans that have been mentioned on the LLL board, including the most recent lending activity on each loan:\r\nhttp://starfish.dynalias.org/\r\nSee loans in real time, as they are made:\r\nhttp://www.http://kivalive.com/index2.php\r\n\r\nLists are posted on the LLL Team message \r\nboard.

The family lives on the Big Island and her treatment is on Oahu.\r\nive year old Faith was diagnosed with Leukemia and the news comes almost one year to the date Faithy's Auntie Nohea passed away from Breast Cancer. This is a devastating blow but her name says it all - we have FAITH she will beat this. In addition to this challenge the family lives on the Big Island of Hawaii and her treating physician's are on Oahu. Medical coverage it handles only 90% and in addition to the 10% financial burden the family has to factor in airfare and lodging for each medical treatment and specialist appointment. Neav McAlister is one of my oldest, and dearest friends. My family. Neav and Greta share godmother responsibilities to my oldest son, Alex and Greta and I share Faith as a goddaughter. Neav and Rafer welcomed Faith in 2008 and it was the best day ever! Faith has an older brother and sister, Grace and Levi who live on the mainland and just left after their annual two month summer visit. Faith is a little spitfire of energy who recently celebrated her birthday (8/14) and started kindergarten. She is a true Hawaiian girl with a little accent, saying \"yeah?\" after every sentence! Every donation and prayer and re-share helps. Please keep Faith and the family in your thoughts and prayers.\r\nLove always,\r\nGrandma Peggy, Uncle Peter, Aunt Chelsea, Aunt Dawn, Auntie Jake, Auntie Greta and cousins: Alex, Chiara, Amber & Wyatt and Savannah, Sydney & Kennedy.\r\n\r\n",

Neav McAlister is one of my oldest, and dearest friends. My family. Neav and Greta share godmother responsibilities to my oldest son, Alex and Greta and I share Faith as a goddaughter. Neav and Rafer welcomed Faith in 2008 and it was the best day ever! Faith has an older brother and sister, Grace and Levi who live on the mainland and just left after their annual two month summer visit. Faith is a little spitfire of energy who recently celebrated her birthday (8/14) and started kindergarten. She is a true Hawaiian girl with a little accent, saying \"yeah?\" after every sentence! Every donation and prayer and re-share helps. Please keep Faith and the family in your thoughts and prayers.\r\nLove always,\r\nGrandma Peggy, Uncle Peter, Aunt Chelsea, Aunt Dawn, Auntie Jake, Auntie Greta and cousins: Alex, Chiara, Amber & Wyatt and Savannah, Sydney & Kennedy.\r\n\r\n",
