In 1977, DLH Enterprises was started by my dad. We began as a vending business, selling various perishable and nonperishable items. We had hot dog stands, popcorn stands, clothing stands, fruit and vegetable stands, one of the first mobile music stores, and one of the first 24-hour vending stands in the DC Metro area.\r\n\r\nIn 1995, we branched off from DLH Enterprises and started LKH Enterprise Management (LKHEM).  We offered administrative support to various corporations.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, we started Dark City Entertainment with the hope of offering talent management and entertainment services to the DC Metro Area.\r\n\r\nIn 2002, we expanded our business by offering legal services.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, we expanded even further and began offering products / services in the event ticket sales, health, beauty, telecommunications, travel, financial fields.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate you stopping by, your patronage, and submitting your comments/suggestions.",
