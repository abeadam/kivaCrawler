                "description": "Alan's account of the founding of LLL is on the  team board @Alan re: #260143. Loans that are nearing expiry won't get funded if they don't get noticed. We look for loans that are about to expire by using the Sort By:\r\n\"Expiring Soon\" option instead of the default \"Popularity\", and then work to get them funded.\r\n\r\nSee our team FAQ, linked above (the \"Team Website\" button, next to our traffic light avatar).\r\n\r\nA Team LLL glossary (contributed by team member Tony):\r\n\r\nRed Loans: Loans that have less than five days to be funded, identifiable by the red box with the notice that says \"Only x days left!\" or \r\n\"Only x hours and y minutes left!\"\r\n\r\nLLL - Late Loaning Lenders: this team, where \r\nlenders work together to keep loans from \r\nexpiring.\r\n\r\nSFDD - Starfish Daily Dozen: Under current \r\npractice, one of these lists is prepared and \r\nposted for each day, to help LLL lenders focus \r\nand coordinate their lending on a targeted \r\ngroup of loans (the Starfish or SF). The lists \r\nare prepared by a group of volunteers who \r\nseek to be objective in selecting the loans to \r\nbe included in their lists. They also seek to \r\nspread out the loans in each list over a 24 hour \r\nperiod and to share the joy among the Field \r\nPartners with loans expiring during that period, \r\nbut their efforts are always constrained by the \r\nchoice of loans that are available for inclusion \r\nin the list. Loans with larger amounts needed \r\nwill be included in the period immediately after \r\neach Credit Day, when lenders are feeling \r\nflush, but the lists will become less ambitious \r\nwhen the LLL lenders are feeling poor.\r\n\r\nGG - Gorgeous Group: The SFDD list-makers usually add one or two of these loans at the end of the SF daily dozen lists. As the name \r\nimplies, only group loans are picked. When it is \r\nfirst posted, a typical GG loan will expire two \r\ndays or more after the list is posted. It will \r\nusually be retained as a GG until it becomes \r\nFully Funded or moves into Starfish range. The amount needed when the loan is selected as a GG will vary depending on the time of month.\r\n\r\nOPM - Abbreviation for \"other people's money.\"  Our main lending method is to coordinate LLL team members' loans, so that we make several loans to a borrower within a short period of time. This will move the borrower's loan request up in Kiva's \"popularity\" sort and get the loan noticed by other people (non-members of the LLL team).  Many loans then get their funding completed by loans from those non-LLL members.  By attracting other lenders' attention to our Starfish loans in this way, we multiply the impact of our finite funds, and save more loans from expiring than we otherwise could.\r\n\r\nRTR - Reduce the Red: These lists are \r\nprepared and posted when there are large \r\nnumbers of loans slated to expire in a short \r\nperiod of time. \"Red\" is a reference to the red \r\nboxes that are added to a loan description \r\nwhen the Loan is about to expire without full \r\nfunding.\r\n\r\nBulge: A short period in which a great many loans have their scheduled funding expiration times. This may happen when, for example, the volunteer coordinators at Kiva offer a promo of some kind to the editors & translators, to get them to do a lot of work in a very short period of time. Bulge loans are prime candidates for inclusion in Reduce the Red lists.\r\n\r\nBTB - Battling the Boxes: On those days where \r\nthere aren't 12 loans that qualify as \"Starfish,\" the listmakers will include loans that have their red boxes, but more than 24 hours left before their deadline, to make up the 12 loans for the list. The criteria are similar to SF \r\nloans, i.e., one per field partner and reasonable \r\namounts left to fund (not too much; not too \r\nlittle), except that these loans may have a longer time left before their expiry date. If they gain good traction on their first BTB day, they may be carried forward. If not ... they stand a second chance as SF.\r\n\r\nFF - Fully Funded: This is LLL code for a loan \r\nthat has received all the loans required for it to be removed from the list of loans that are raising funds \r\nand to move into paying back status.\r\n\r\nLars Ratio: the average funding per hour that is needed for a loan to become fully funded.\r\n(Developed by team member Lars)\r\n\r\nWiedergänger (contributed by Maria) - German expression, literal translation \"again walker,\" meaning \"undead,\" i.e. a person that has died but comes back, aka a zombie.

Their parents are so poor they could never afford surgery. Being born with a cleft in a developing country is truly a curse, and no one knows how many newborns with clefts are killed or abandoned right after birth.  \r\n\r\nThrough Smile Train's free cleft surgery program, a 45 minute surgery gives these children a future and a second chance at life that they never thought they'd get. Let's change the world, one smile at a time!\r\n\r\nThrough our Kiva lending we want to raise awareness and support of the wonderful work Smile Train does in providing free cleft repair surgeries around the world. If our team logo is displayed on loans' top lending teams we hope other Kiva lenders will learn about Smile Train's work too.  Won't you join us?\r\n.\r\n",

Our team also includes staff members of Smile Train and Kiva and other microfinance ventures.  We would be happy for you to join our team too!\r\n\r\nThe little girl in our team logo is Pinki Sonkar.  She was born with a severe cleft into a family that was surviving on less than a dollar a day in a poor rural village in India. She could not go to school because the other children threw rocks at her.  Smile Pinki tells the story of how her life was changed forever by a free repair surgery at a Smile Train partner hospital.  Contact a team captain for more information if you would like a free DVD of this Academy Award winning documentary.\r\n\r\nWhere is Pinki Now - http://bit.ly/WhereisPinkiNow - This 5 minute video has interviews with Pinki's parents and teachers and video of Pinki in school.
