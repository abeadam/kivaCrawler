Are you ready to teach your kids how to have money work hard for them and not be dependent on a pension, the government or someone else to take care of them later in life?\r\n\r\nGive your children the financial head start necessary to thrive in today's fast paced and changing world.\r\n\r\n\"I will recommend this program to every kid I can. It is the up and coming kids who are our future leaders and entrepreneurs.\"\r\n- Bill Bartmann, National Entrepreneur of the Year, http://www.BillBartmann.com\r\n\r\n\"This is the perfect resource for any kid who wants to ignite their entrepreneurial spirit.\"\r\n- Lu An Mitchell, Canada's #1 Female Entrepreneur, Motivational Speaker & Philanthropist, \r\nhttp://www.LuAnMitchell.com\r\n\r\n“It’s about time we had a curriculum to teach children real-life skills so every  child can grow up feeling confident and secure about finances.
