Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

We propose a simple but powerful model for transforming our obstacles into the raw material of our dreams. Our approach, is an in depth exploration into our idea that all human beings are possessed by fears and pregnant with dreams.\r\n“The art of being a river” proposes a radical rethink in how we pursue our goals and our approach to crisis management. He points out that every mental and emotional chaos is organized the moment that the mind chooses an altruistic course, with a purpose that transcends our personal interests. Our manifesto is “let us be a River and not a Swamp!” We can use our talents either to build or to destroy; to become stagnant and isolate ourselves like the swamp; or to flow, contribute and irrigate fields like a river. The life of a person that has resembled a swamp becomes diaphanous and clear when a cause, a purpose, a focus, a mission are discovered.\r\n\r\nExcerpt taken from Rodolfo Cabrera´s speech.\r\n\r\nIn life, we can choose to be a river or we can choose to be a swamp. The talent of the swamp, is the same talent as the river, water. You and me just as swamps and rivers, we have talents.\r\nTalent is simply energy…raw potential and just as energy it is neither good nor bad. It can be good or it can be bad. It all depends on how we choose to use it.\r\nWe can use our talents to build or to destroy; to stagnate, decay and isolate ourselves like the swamp; or we can use to help, to contribute and irrigate fields like the river.\r\nThe paradox of the swamp is that the less it gives, the more it dries up. The paradox of the river is that the more it gives, the more it receives, the more it shares, the more it grows, and as a result of sharing its water with the valley, every river reaches its DREAM, the ocean.\r\nEvery one of your DREAMS…is possible to be achieved.\r\nThere is only one imposible thing in life,… to plant an apple and harvest an orange. \r\nSo it is impossible, not improbable, imposible, to plant GRATITUDE and not harvest your DREAMS!  WHY??\r\nBecause GRATITUDE breeds ABUNDANCE, ABUNDANCE breeds GENEROSITY, GENEROSITY breeds COURAGE, and COURAGE is the fertilizer of the seed of our DREAMS\r\n¿What are the talents, you are most grateful for, most proud of, and can you generously share them to build a better world?\r\nLet us be a river and not a swamp!!!...\r\n\r\n",

In 2011 'Genealogists for Families' received an award for Best New Community Project.\r\n\r\nThrough Kiva, a non-profit organisation working with microfinance institutions, you choose a borrower to support with a loan of just $5 (through Kiva Zip) or $25 (on the main Kiva site). Similar loans by other lenders are combined until the required total is reached. This enables people without access to traditional banks (including many women) to expand their businesses, support and educate their children, save for the future and raise themselves out of poverty. As your money is repaid (often in monthly instalments), you can withdraw it or lend it to someone else. Money that is loaned over and over again does more good than a one-time donation!\r\n\r\nAnyone *who makes a loan* through Kiva can be a member of this team. You can invite your family and friends to join even if they are not involved in genealogy.\r\n\r\n** Please read http://genfamilies.blogspot.com/search/label/FAQ (which has important information and answers to frequently asked questions).",
