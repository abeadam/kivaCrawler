This team is about making that money work – by shifting excess unused capital from your household into Kiva, you can help others while staying financially secure!\r\n\r\nKeeping a high balance in your checking/savings account is unnecessary for many people. The yearly interest you earn on this amount, even in high-yield savings, usually won’t even top $100 on $10,000 in the current interest rate climate. How many Kiva entrepreneurs could you help with that money? (Answer: up to 800!*)\r\n\r\nShift some of that redundant money to Kiva and help alleviate poverty!\r\n\r\nNotes: Since this money is being shifted from funds that you are somewhat used to having at your disposition, it is important that you are selective with your loans. You can loan to whoever you want, but it’s prudent to have this money available in a reasonable amount of time. Remember, you cannot get money from Kiva back immediately; you have to wait for repayments. That’s why we recommend investing in short-term loans of 5 or 6 months (so your repayments come in quickly and you can recoup all of your capital within half a year), spreading loans across multiple entrepreneurs/field partners/geographical regions (“diversifying” your loans to mitigate risk), and choosing field partners that have at least a 3-star rating (higher ratings means less delinquent/defaulted loans). Following these suggestions minimizes the risk inherent in loaning on Kiva.\r\n\r\n*Assuming you invest the $10,000 in individual $25 loans of ",

We received photos of candles from around the world, which provided comfort. This Kiva lending team is a virtual candle we're lighting in memory of great dads everywhere - their light and love will live on.\r\n\r\n...................\r\n\r\nHOW TO LOAN WITH OUR KIVA TEAM:\r\n\r\n1. Join Kiva, then join our \"Candles for Dads\" Lending Team.\r\n2. After you've joined our Lending Team, find a dad on Kiva to loan to and make a loan of $25 or more.\r\n3. During checkout, select to have your loan count towards our \"Candles for Dads\" Kiva Team's collective impact. Thanks!\r\n\r\nHOW TO FIND DADS ON KIVA TO LOAN TO:\r\n1. Find a Featured Candles for Dads loan on our Team Activity page, or on our Facebook page: www.facebook.com/candlesfordads\r\n2. Search for new dads to support on Kiva by clicking \"Lend\" in the Kiva main menu, then filter your search by gender and read profiles to find dads to loan to. Share your finds with us on facebook so we chip in as a group (we're still a small group, so plan to feature 1-2 loans a month for now). \r\n...................\r\n\r\nHELP SHARE CANDLES FOR DADS:\r\n1. Please connect with us on Facebook & Twitter and invite friends to join us:\r\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/candlesfordads\r\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/candlesfordads\r\nWebsite: http://candlesfordads.org (forwards to Kiva Team Page)\r\n2. Recruit friends to join our Kiva Lending Team. Kiva has some cool recruiting tools that (sometimes) even give you and friends who join a $25 credit to make loans when they join: http://www.kiva.org/team/CandlesForDads/recruit \r\n3. Volunteer Research for Dad Loan Suggestions: If you find a great dad on Kiva for us to loan to, share the Kiva profiles on our facebook page so others on our team can chip in to reach the goal. We will feature at least one C4D loan each month.\r\n4. Share a memory of a great dad you are donating in memory of on our facebook and twitter.\r\n......................\r\n\r\nIn memory of our dad, Shaman Mullick (1947 - 2012), and great dads everywhere.
