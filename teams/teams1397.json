So besides the loans from the Flash Mob team, Flash Mob loans often attract many additional loans from other lenders who just happened to log into Kiva at this time. Sometimes a loan gets completely funded within the hour!\r\n\r\nFeel free to keep attributing your loans to your favorite team, it is fun to see many different team logos on the same loan.\r\n\r\n",

So besides the loans from the Flash Mob team, Flash Mob loans often attract many additional loans from other lenders who just happened to log into Kiva at this time. Sometimes a loan gets completely funded within the hour!\r\n\r\nFeel free to keep attributing your loans to your favorite team, it is fun to see many different team logos on the same loan.\r\n\r\n",

For maximum Flash Mob impact, please try to loan exactly at Flash Mob time.\r\n\r\nFor email alerts with just the daily loan link, please join http://www.kiva.org/team/KFM_messages and set your email preferences for that team to immediate delivery.

CORENA's projects are all based in Australia and are funded through our website, corenafund.org.au. The loans made on Kiva in the name of this Lending Team are in no way funded by donations made to CORENA. \r\n\r\nCORENA (Citizens Own Renewable Energy Network Australia Inc) is a people-powered funding mechanism, not unlike Kiva, designed to speed up the transition to 100% renewable energy. \r\n\r\n**Quick Win project fund (rolling)\r\nCORENA uses the donated funds to give an interest-free loan to a non-profit community organisation to pay for solar panels (and other efficiency measures), and they pay back the loan out of subsequent savings on their power bills (it doesn't cost them a cent!). The loan repayments then go towards funding the next Quick Win project. CORENA was formed in 2013, and has already completed two installations, which are now helping fund the 3rd project: solar for Beechworth Montessori School.\r\n\r\n**Big Win project fund \r\nWe plan to build Australia's first community-owned, large scale (50MW) Solar Thermal plant with molten salt storage at Port Augusta, in South Australia. The plant will provide cheap, clean energy that never runs out, and will be owned collectively by ‘the people’ and operated for the benefit of all. If around 720,000 people each contribute $8 per week for ONE year, we can fund this project entirely by donations. There’ll be no loan repayments or dividends to shareholders, so all profits will be used to build yet more people’s solar plants.",
