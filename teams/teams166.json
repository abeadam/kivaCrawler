                "description": "10 reasons to shop local\r\nâ€¦things to let your customers know\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Local shops sell a wide range of great products at affordable\r\nprices.\r\n\r\nMany people get out of the habit of shopping locally and are\r\nthen surprised by the range of products and gifts available.\r\n\r\n2. Shopping locally saves you money\r\n\r\nOut of town shops have done a good job of convincing us all that\r\nsole traders = expensive, but the evidence just isnâ€™t there to back\r\nthis up. If you add in travel, parking costs, fees to transport larger\r\nitems home and customer time, the overall cost is often much\r\ngreater.\r\n\r\n3. Shopping locally retains our communities\r\n\r\nPeople donâ€™t like losing shops and services in small towns and\r\nvillages but donâ€™t equate this to how they spend their money. Shops\r\nwill only survive if customers spend locally â€“ so if you want a vibrant\r\ntown centre, where people can socialise as well as shop, we need to\r\nencourage people to shop locally.\r\n\r\n4. Shopping locally retains our distinctiveness â€“ avoid clone\r\ntowns!\r\n\r\nMany town centres in Britain look the same with franchises and\r\nmultinationals. Independent shops create distinctive shopping\r\nexperiences and stock different products. Independent shops keep\r\ntraditional local products alive. They respond more quickly to the\r\nneeds of local customers, stocking products to meet the changing\r\npopulation needs. They can also be more innovativeâ€¦â€¦.organic\r\nproducts were first developed by independent traders!\r\n\r\n5. Shopping locally saves the environment\r\n\r\nWe are all aware of CO2 emissions and our environmental impact.\r\nLocal shops often stock a higher percentage of locally sourced goods\r\nfor which distribution time and customer journey times are reduced.\r\nThis helps reduce our global footprint.\r\n\r\n6. Shopping locally creates jobs\r\n\r\nShops in our town centres and villages create local employment and\r\nself employment. These people in turn spend in the local economy.\r\nOver half a million people are employed in retail in our rural towns\r\nand villages. Evidence shows that for every Â£10 spent in an\r\nindependent shop, Â£25 is generated for the local economy compared\r\nto Â£14 spent in multinationals.\r\n\r\n7. Local independent shops invest more in our communities\r\n\r\nSole traders and independent stores are proportionally more\r\ngenerous in their support for local charities, carnivals, schools and\r\ncommunity events. So supporting local shops means a financial\r\nreturn for our community.\r\n\r\n8. Local shops are for everyone\r\n\r\nMost people can get to their local shops easily. This is especially\r\nimportant for the elderly, the vulnerable, young people and those\r\nwithout private transport. Keeping your shops open by buying locally\r\nhelps the whole community.\r\n\r\n9. Local shops value you more\r\n\r\nEvidence from numerous surveys shows people receive better\r\ncustomer care and service in local shops. Traders survive by their\r\nreputation and repeat business â€“ so shopping locally means that you\r\nget a higher standard of service.\r\n\r\n10. Shopping locally saves services\r\n\r\nPrivate, voluntary and public sector services cluster around shops.\r\nThe loss of the high street often corresponds to a reduction in these\r\nservices. As shops disappear, so do hairdressers, vets, dentists etc",

Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

                "description": "In our team, we have a vision to change lives in novel ways. Our team's origin began with a Kiva Card (gift certificate) whose recipient founded this team. Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.
