The dominant theme is that the rich will never let the poor get ahead and will do everything in their considerable power to keep them down. But Kiva is the real deal, and even though we're not a rich nation, we're definitely not the poorest -- not by a long shot. Few folks realize that, but this team is well aware and knows that our middle class is slowly wobbling its way up to firmer plateaus. We can help those that are truly needy self-starters, especially with Kiva and its field partners doing the groundwork.",

They bring people together in a way that enables them to help each other from across the globe.
