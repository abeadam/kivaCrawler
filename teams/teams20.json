Yea!\" \r\n\r\nThis year, you can post that kind message here...but it's going to cost you. \r\n\r\n20 people x $10 per person ...see where I'm going with this? \r\n\r\nThe goal is $200. Guess what? I'm planning a trip to Africa for 2013 and Philice needs $200. So let's give it all to her: http://www.kiva.org/lend/389089  \r\n\r\nI realize that Kiva loans must be $25 or more. That's a little steep. So, if you don't want to donate that much, PayPal me (jordy.clements@gmail.com) or Dwolla me (812-735-3988) or mail me or hand me $10, and I will donated on your behalf. \r\n\r\nIf we don't get to the goal, I'll try to make up the difference, and if we do make it there, hey, maybe I'll give a little more. Plus, remember it's Kiva: YOU'RE PROBABLY GETTING ALL YOUR MONEY BACK.\r\n\r\nAnd oh, by the way. \r\n\r\nThanks. \r\n\r\n{see you next year}",

The loan \r\ndescriptions are prepared for posting by \r\ntranslating the loan descriptions (if necessary) \r\nand editing them, and they are then held in a queue by Kiva's server, to be posted when the FP has freed up some of its credit limit on Kiva, by making some repayments. Bulge loans are prize candidates for inclusion \r\nin Reduce the Red lists.\r\n\r\nFF - Fully Funded: This is LLL code for a loan \r\nthat has received all the loans required for it to be removed from the list of loans that are raising funds \r\nand to move into paying back status.\r\n\r\nLars Ratio: the average funding per hour that is needed for a loan to become fully funded.\r\n(Developed by team member Lars)\r\n\r\nWiedergänger (contributed by Maria) - German expression, literal translation \"again walker,\" meaning \"undead,\" i.e. a person that has died but comes back, aka a zombie. Here it means a loan that disappears from the page, but comes back again because somebody didn't check out their basket.\r\n\r\nRuma sana (contributed by Jouko and Potkukelkka) - Finnish expression, literal translation \"ugly words.\"  It is a phrase to use when you are very frustrated, but want to stop just short of actual cursing -- for example, when the Kiva site repeatedly logs you out when you are trying to rescue an expiring loan at the last second.\r\n\r\nSee data about all loans currently fundraising on Kiva:\r\nwww.kivatools.com\r\nSee data about loans that have been mentioned on the LLL board, including the most recent lending activity on each loan:\r\nhttp://starfish.dynalias.org/\r\nSee loans in real time, as they are made:\r\nhttp://www.http://kivalive.com/index2.php\r\n\r\nLists are posted on the LLL Team message \r\nboard.
