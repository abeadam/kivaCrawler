It is the forum where the villagers are making world wide contacts by hosting guests freely and exchanging cultural values. Our home stay programme have opened doors with contacts from all continents and in return some of our guests have participated in funding some of the community projects.\r\n\r\nFurthermore we lobby for the african childhood who stay in the village and fight difficulties meeting their daily needs due to a certain disadvantage; for instance: if the child had lost one or both parents due to H.I.V./Aids or if the parents are too poor to afford offering the child the basic needs and education. Our popular programme called Omega Child is the core for formula for success and in order to support African Child in this programme we conduce long distance adoptions, talent search, placement at a children home, and other initiatives.\r\n\r\nOur core values are networking and collaboration as a basis for acquiring and sharing cultural diversity. We advocate for community participation and resource mobilization, planning, monitoring and evaluation of the projects for the benefit of the community and the funding agents.\r\n\r\nWe indeed collaborate with young people, parents, teachers, professionals, community leaders and others the effort to empower young people and promote their contribution in the community around the issues of familiar planning, health, H.I.V./Aids, environment conservation, leadership, and any other key inter-related socioeconomic affairs. There are affiliated projects in the slums as some of those young people living in the village come to the city after school, in search of jobs hence having a new home in the slum after failing to secure any job in the city. At the moment we are encouraging them to come back to the village and help in mobilizing the available resources and participate within the project.\r\n\r\nIn summary, African child initiative has 4 key areas of intervention in the village:\r\n\r\n    * Poverty eradication\r\n    * Entrepreneurship encouraging\r\n    * Community development\r\n    * Education and learning with special emphasis in computer literacy\r\n\r\nWe identify critical issues that concern this villages, slums, and community and translate them into short term and long term programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR MISSION\r\n\r\nTo approach community development from the grass roots.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR VISION\r\n\r\nTo advocate for self and community empowerment.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can you be of help to our initiative?\r\n\r\n    *\r\n\r\n      You can make any form of contribution (materials, cash, skills and ideas) towards any of our numerous projects.\r\n    *\r\n\r\n      You can be part of the network, campaign or volunteer to work with one or any of our projects.\r\n    *\r\n\r\n      Be part of our cultural ambassadors by visiting our village and joining our cultural exchange programme.\r\n\r\n\r\nThadeus M.

Some of the benefits that sponsorship provides are medical and dental care, educational assistance, Youth Programs, nutrition programs, clothing and shoes, and even scholarships and much more. Also, Children International allows sponsors to help their children's families to start or expand a business (if the family is able to and would like to) by sending them a Special Needs Gift for an Income Generating Project. You may of course send money for other items like food or clothing or whatever your sponsored child's or families special needs are and it is up to you whether you want to specify what the gift is for or you may leave it up to the family to decide. Some sponsors help with home repairs or even have helped build the family a house! (Check out www.aurashouse.com). CI has a great website, blog, and a Google group for those who aren't aware.

Electronic waste like cell phones pollute the environment (up to 35,000 gallons per phone) and microfinance has been proven to be an effective poverty alleviation tool.  In response to these issues and as a fundraising technique The Chiapas Project, a Dallas based 501(c)3 non profit founded by Lucy Billingsley, created a program called Recycle to Eradicate Poverty.\r\n \r\nIn one sentence, we recycle used cell phones to fund microfinance loans to the poor.\r\n \r\nAt www.turnphonesintoloans.org/, we allow anyone who has access to the Internet to get pre-paid baggies and make a difference for free.  After entering in your information, we send as many baggies as you want to your address within 3-5 business days so that you can in turn distribute them among events, in offices, to pass out, etc. Each person simply puts their cell phones inside a baggie (up to 5 per bag) and places it into their mailbox. \r\n\r\nUsing this process and the support of an organization such as yours, we hope to beat the One Million Cell Phone Challenge.  Recycling one million cell phones across America will save 350 trillion gallons of water and allow 100,000 women to rise from poverty through microfinance).  Click here to watch our short video or here to wach our longer video on youtube.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0hPfPdQo_o&feature=channel\r\n\r\n * Would your organization be interested in becoming a partner or ordering baggies from our website?\r\n\r\nwe are looking forward to hear from you.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nKarthiga",

Now we are continuing our involvement with Turame in an even more hands-on-way - by becoming microfinance lenders. \r\n\r\nHow to get involved:\r\n1. Click the join team button to the left [if you are new to Kiva you will need to create an account].\r\n\r\n2. Choose a Borrower: Check out the current Turame loans by scrolling down at this link: [http://bit.ly/pGU0sd] If there are no new loans, check back in as Turame posts new loans twice a month.\r\n\r\n3. Make a Loan:\r\n\r\n4. Get Repaid: Over the course of 6 months your loan will get repaid to you in the form of Kiva credit. [This is a loan, not a donation]\r\n\r\n5. Repeat.  You can take the money and put it back in your pocket or make a loan to another group.\r\n\r\nThanks for helping support Turame Community Finance in providing loans to those living in one of the poorest countries on the planet. \r\nYou can learn more about Turame here: www.kiva.org/partners/162",

We received photos of candles from around the world, which provided comfort. This Kiva lending team is a virtual candle we're lighting in memory of great dads everywhere - their light and love will live on.\r\n\r\n...................\r\n\r\nHOW TO LOAN WITH OUR KIVA TEAM:\r\n\r\n1. Join Kiva, then join our \"Candles for Dads\" Lending Team.\r\n2. After you've joined our Lending Team, find a dad on Kiva to loan to and make a loan of $25 or more.\r\n3. During checkout, select to have your loan count towards our \"Candles for Dads\" Kiva Team's collective impact. Thanks!\r\n\r\nHOW TO FIND DADS ON KIVA TO LOAN TO:\r\n1. Find a Featured Candles for Dads loan on our Team Activity page, or on our Facebook page: www.facebook.com/candlesfordads\r\n2. Search for new dads to support on Kiva by clicking \"Lend\" in the Kiva main menu, then filter your search by gender and read profiles to find dads to loan to. Share your finds with us on facebook so we chip in as a group (we're still a small group, so plan to feature 1-2 loans a month for now). \r\n...................\r\n\r\nHELP SHARE CANDLES FOR DADS:\r\n1. Please connect with us on Facebook & Twitter and invite friends to join us:\r\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/candlesfordads\r\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/candlesfordads\r\nWebsite: http://candlesfordads.org (forwards to Kiva Team Page)\r\n2. Recruit friends to join our Kiva Lending Team. Kiva has some cool recruiting tools that (sometimes) even give you and friends who join a $25 credit to make loans when they join: http://www.kiva.org/team/CandlesForDads/recruit \r\n3. Volunteer Research for Dad Loan Suggestions: If you find a great dad on Kiva for us to loan to, share the Kiva profiles on our facebook page so others on our team can chip in to reach the goal. We will feature at least one C4D loan each month.\r\n4. Share a memory of a great dad you are donating in memory of on our facebook and twitter.\r\n......................\r\n\r\nIn memory of our dad, Shaman Mullick (1947 - 2012), and great dads everywhere. Your love and light live on. ",

As a lender, you can choose who to lend to -- whether a baker in Managua or a hammock maker in Masaya -- and as the entrepreneur repays the loan, you get your money back. \r\n\r\nWhat happens if I join this team?\r\n\r\nYou register for your own Kiva account, and as you lend to entrepreneurs, you can choose to \"count\" your loans towards your team's impact. The loan is still yours, and repayments still come to you - but you can also choose to have the loan show up in the team's collective portfolio, so the team's overall impact will grow!\r\n\r\nHow do I make a Kiva loan?\r\nSelect an entrepreneur on the Kiva website, checkout, and receive updates as the entrepreneur repays the loan. At the end of the loan term, re-lend repaid loan funds to a new entrepreneur or withdraw them from Kiva. \r\n",

Sufferers are afflicted by an absence of melanin, a pigmentation defect in the hair, skin and eyes. It causes vulnerability to sun exposure and bright light. Many have very poor vision as a consequence. In tropical countries especially they can be vulnerable to skin cancers if unprotected from the sun.\r\n\r\nThough it might seem absurdly obvious, Albinism has nothing to do with magical powers. \r\n\r\nBut in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, albinos have traditionally faced discrimination and prejudice. They are associated with the supernatural. To some, a white-skinned African person is seen as a kind of phantom or ghost, who rather than die will dissolve or disappear with the wind and rain. \r\n\r\nOver the last five years in Tanzania, however, the situation has become much, much worse, with albinos increasingly subjected to murder and mutilation because of a completely absurd myth that albino body parts are effective in witchcraft rituals. Albino bones are also used as good luck charms and people believe they can make you rich.\r\n",
                "description": "Attacks on albinos continue, despite international outrage and repeated attempts by the Tanzanian government to stamp out this truly appalling practice, since it first came to light that many albinos have been hunted down and attacked purely for their limbs and organs. \r\n\r\nOfficially there are around 8,000 albinos registered by the Tanzania Albino Society (TAS), but they says the real number is in excess of 170,000. Many albinos are still kept hidden by their families because of the stigma or because of fear that they might be attacked.\r\n\r\nPlease check following documentary: http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/africainvestigates/2011/11/201111185428766652.html\r\nMeet two albino children, victims of vicious assault. A 12-year-old boy called Adam (see team photo), who had part of his hand cut off and a 16-year-old girl, whose arm was hacked off. Their body parts sold for witchcraft rituals or good luck charms. (You may find some of the images disturbing)\r\n\r\nMore info:\r\nTAS accepted the Martin Luther King Major Drum for Justice Award on behalf of albinos living in Tanzania in a ceremony at the US Embassy on January 15th 2009.\r\n\r\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7148673.stm\r\n\r\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/08/world/africa/08albino.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1\r\n\r\nhttp://www.add.org.uk/case_study.asp?ref=94\r\n",
