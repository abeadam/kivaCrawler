This is a forum to notify each other of environmentally sustainable loans that are needing funding. Sustainable development projects include recycling, solar, re-use, organic agriculture, health, etc. \r\n\r\nWe support enterprises that care about the earth and all of its inhabitants. We have no religious, racial or political affiliations of any kind. We want to encourage sustainable enterprises that recycle, reuse, repurpose and use environmentally sound agricultural and manufacturing practices. \r\nMany of us would like Kiva to develop environmental standards or criteria for their lending practices to prevent environmental impacts that would increase poverty for future generations.\r\nMany people want to have a green portfolio, or at least a green component. \r\nWon't you join us in creating true sustainability that includes a healthy environment?",

This is a forum to notify each other of environmentally sustainable loans that are needing funding. Sustainable development projects include recycling, solar, re-use, organic agriculture, health, etc. \r\n\r\nWe support enterprises that care about the earth and all of its inhabitants. We have no religious, racial or political affiliations of any kind. We want to encourage sustainable enterprises that recycle, reuse, repurpose and use environmentally sound agricultural and manufacturing practices. \r\nMany of us would like Kiva to develop environmental standards or criteria for their lending practices to prevent environmental impacts that would increase poverty for future generations.\r\nMany people want to have a green portfolio, or at least a green component. \r\nWon't you join us in creating true sustainability that includes a healthy environment?",

                "description": "(Note: this team was formerly called \"Kiva High School\")\r\n\r\nKiva U Schools is an international network of students and their\r\nrespective chapters, unified by a belief that poverty can be alleviated and that\r\nmicrofinance is an effective tool to achieve this end. Students organize chapters to join with like-minded students in their community and\r\naround the country to raise money to battle poverty, not with sympathy, but with business transactions rooted in mutual dignity. Kiva U is guided by\r\nthese goals, which we affirm to be our mission:\r\n\r\n • To inspire awareness of global issues, especially poverty and hunger;\r\n\r\n• To bring together and subsequently organize students interested in fighting\r\npoverty;\r\n\r\n• To encourage interest in microfinance as a tool to combat poverty;\r\n\r\n• To raise money to invest in worthy entrepreneurs in developing states,\r\ncountering the predatory loaning practices so prevalent among the world's poorest regions;\r\n\r\n• To develop in its members a sense of global responsibility;\r\n\r\n• To enable others to become more aware of global issues such as poverty\r\nand help them realize the power of microfinance;\r\n\r\n• To establish a network of high school chapters around the country in which\r\nthis organization will be a central resource;\r\n\r\n• To allow high school students to play a direct role in alleviating global\r\npoverty through loans to entrepreneurs in the developing world.",

                "description": "In our team, we have a vision to change lives in novel ways. Our team's origin began with a Kiva Card (gift certificate) whose recipient founded this team. Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.
