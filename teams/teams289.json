Launched in February, 2007, Green Options Media has grown into a leader among “green” news and information sources aimed at general audiences.\r\n\r\nWritten by experienced professionals and topic experts, Green Options Media’s individual blogs engage visitors with authoritative content, compelling discussions, and actionable advice. Users new to the “green life” can contribute to the conversation by joining in dialogue between our writers and visitors on individual blogs. We don’t preach to the choir, or require a commitment to our vision: we invite anyone with questions, or simply curiosity, to add their voices to the community, and share their approaches to achieving abundance while lightening their environmental footprint.\r\n\r\nGO Media was acquired in Q4 of 2008 by activism startup Virgance. Virgance represents an entirely new way to do business, functioning as an incubator for positive change. You can read about the acquisition and Virgance in TechCrunch.",
