Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

For wealthy and developed nations such as Japan and the United States, it is important to act as selfless friends to our developing neighbors in their times of need. We often believe erroneously that we, as individuals, cannot make a difference in the world; but this is not the case. $25 at a time, we can improve the world that we all live in.",

Since then, KANKEI has strived to expand foreign language education from the confines of the traditional classroom and out into the spontaneity of the real world. KANKEI is proud and honored to connect participants with caring host families, prestigious schools, innovative instructors, and rigorous language programs that contribute to a truly worldly education. KANKEI was established on the belief that cultural understanding is essential to creating a world characterized by peace and harmony. We sincerely hope you will join us on our mission to achieve this vision and revolutionize foreign language education.",

Go to the Website listed below to find new businesses seeking loans. \r\n\r\nWhat is Kiva?\r\n\r\nKiva is the world's first person-to-person micro-lending website, empowering individuals to lend directly to unique entrepreneurs across the globe. As a lender, you can choose who to lend to -- whether a baker in Managua or a hammock maker in Masaya -- and as the entrepreneur repays the loan, you get your money back. \r\n\r\nWhat happens if I join this team?\r\n\r\nYou register for your own Kiva account, and as you lend to entrepreneurs, you can choose to \"count\" your loans towards your team's impact. The loan is still yours, and repayments still come to you - but you can also choose to have the loan show up in the team's collective portfolio, so the team's overall impact will grow!\r\n\r\nHow do I make a Kiva loan?\r\nSelect an entrepreneur on the Kiva website, checkout, and receive updates as the entrepreneur repays the loan. At the end of the loan term, re-lend repaid loan funds to a new entrepreneur or withdraw them from Kiva. \r\n",
