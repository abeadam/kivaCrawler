                "description": "The Kiva website was easy to use and got people connected. Kiva was fun.\r\n\r\nEngineers tend to think in numbers - they rely on numbers for anything and everything. Some take it to the extreme (like using numbers in relationships - classifying/rating friends etc). Obviously, this is not the right thing to do. Depending on numbers is good, as long as it is done artfully and within reason. Problem is - we have so much data today, and such powerful tools to analyze these data that it is pure fun to play with it and very easy to lose track of the big picture/real goal.\r\n\r\nLATEST ACTIVITY\r\n\r\nPlease reinstate the positioning and the format of the \"latest activity\" (to prior to the Feb 19th changes) One was encouraged to join in and even if it was just to see the same picture appear multiple times across the team board. This often happened especially in small teams. Now latest activity is barely visible, because it was shrinked and moved to the lower part of the page. \r\n\r\nMESSAGE BOARDS\r\n\r\nWe critize an overall decline of message board functionality. If one checks in to read messages, no one wants to have to click twice – do not abbreviate messages. It is also no fun to find that one has to leave the messages area to see anything else. It is not inviting about posting messages because before being able to post a, say, question, one has to click „View All“ and there is no indication that that would get you to posting messages. Featured messages subtly alter the relationships between the Team Captains and the regular team members, and that is not a good thing especially if a website is about leveling the playing field. Mechanically, those (usually long) featured posts are getting in the way when lenders try to communicate with each other. The Flag button creates an atmosphere that makes lively discussions less likely. The profile pics appear smaller than before\r\n\r\nPERSONAL PORTFOLIO\r\n\r\n\"It can be difficult to accept the limits on our ability to help others...But when you help just one person, or let one person help you, it can be hard not to glimpse the better world so frustratingly near our grasp.\" (The International Bank of Bob pg. 311)\r\n\r\nNow the portfolio is just another bunch of numbers judging your effectivity. An acceptable solution would be to make a separate page for stats and not make it default. For those who want stats, they can go there and for those of us who just want to check those occasionally we can ignore that page easily. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe page you see when paying for loans got cluttered up.

Unfortunately many of Kiva borrowers rely on their retail business to earn a living- essentially becoming a middleman/woman and in a way only helping themselves and their family. In contrast, producers, makers and artisans create jobs, skilled workers and apprenticeship programs- to name a few- at the same time they spread entrepreneurial spirit, economic prosperity and sustainability for a large number of people.\r\nFrom making goods for basic necessities to technology or creating arts and crafts, all countries have something to offer. Let’s help entrepreneurs who want to help themselves and the people around them. Please join us and let’s make the world a better place through encouraging the spirit of producing, making and artisanship.",

It just takes one small step by each of us lending on kiva. Together we can make it easier for hard working people to get the much-needed capital to sustain and grow their business. We feel blessed to be able to support the aspirations of so many loan recipients who persevere tenaciously for a better quality of life with dignity. Kudos to Kiva.org that allows us to connect for this common cause.",
                "description": "In our team, we have a vision to change lives in novel ways. Our team's origin began with a Kiva Card (gift certificate) whose recipient founded this team. Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

For this reason, we would like to highlight Kiva and encourage our members to learn more about their programs. The gap between the rich and poor in the world is expanding at a monumental rate. For wealthy and developed nations such as Japan and the United States, it is important to act as selfless friends to our developing neighbors in their times of need. We often believe erroneously that we, as individuals, cannot make a difference in the world; but this is not the case. $25 at a time, we can improve the world that we all live in.",

Since then, KANKEI has strived to expand foreign language education from the confines of the traditional classroom and out into the spontaneity of the real world. KANKEI is proud and honored to connect participants with caring host families, prestigious schools, innovative instructors, and rigorous language programs that contribute to a truly worldly education. KANKEI was established on the belief that cultural understanding is essential to creating a world characterized by peace and harmony. We sincerely hope you will join us on our mission to achieve this vision and revolutionize foreign language education.",

Now we are continuing our involvement with Turame in an even more hands-on-way - by becoming microfinance lenders. \r\n\r\nHow to get involved:\r\n1. Click the join team button to the left [if you are new to Kiva you will need to create an account].\r\n\r\n2. Choose a Borrower: Check out the current Turame loans by scrolling down at this link: [http://bit.ly/pGU0sd] If there are no new loans, check back in as Turame posts new loans twice a month.\r\n\r\n3. Make a Loan:\r\n\r\n4. Get Repaid: Over the course of 6 months your loan will get repaid to you in the form of Kiva credit. [This is a loan, not a donation]\r\n\r\n5. Repeat.  You can take the money and put it back in your pocket or make a loan to another group.\r\n\r\nThanks for helping support Turame Community Finance in providing loans to those living in one of the poorest countries on the planet. \r\nYou can learn more about Turame here: www.kiva.org/partners/162",

For wealthy and developed nations such as Japan and the United States, it is important to act as selfless friends to our developing neighbors in their times of need. We often believe erroneously that we, as individuals, cannot make a difference in the world; but this is not the case. $25 at a time, we can improve the world that we all live in.",

Since then, KANKEI has strived to expand foreign language education from the confines of the traditional classroom and out into the spontaneity of the real world. KANKEI is proud and honored to connect participants with caring host families, prestigious schools, innovative instructors, and rigorous language programs that contribute to a truly worldly education. KANKEI was established on the belief that cultural understanding is essential to creating a world characterized by peace and harmony. We sincerely hope you will join us on our mission to achieve this vision and revolutionize foreign language education.",

For this reason, we would like to highlight Kiva and encourage our members to learn more about their programs. The gap between the rich and poor in the world is expanding at a monumental rate. For wealthy and developed nations such as Japan and the United States, it is important to act as selfless friends to our developing neighbors in their times of need. We often believe erroneously that we, as individuals, cannot make a difference in the world; but this is not the case. $25 at a time, we can improve the world that we all live in.",
                "description": "KANKEI, Japanese for 'relationship' and an acronym for 'The Koukou American-Nippon Knowledge Exchange through Immersion Program,' was founded as a joint effort between Japan’s Hokkaido Sapporo Hokuryo High School and America’s East Chapel Hill High School in 2004. Since then, KANKEI has strived to expand foreign language education from the confines of the traditional classroom and out into the spontaneity of the real world. KANKEI is proud and honored to connect participants with caring host families, prestigious schools, innovative instructors, and rigorous language programs that contribute to a truly worldly education. KANKEI was established on the belief that cultural understanding is essential to creating a world characterized by peace and harmony. We sincerely hope you will join us on our mission to achieve this vision and revolutionize foreign language education.",

Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.
