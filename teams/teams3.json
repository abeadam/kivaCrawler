While the reasons girls drop out of school are complex, it is clear that pregnancy and parenting responsibilities are a significant factor, and the economic consequences of dropping out of school are devastating for these teen mothers, their children, and their communities. \r\n\r\nOften, girls that become pregnant in school are expelled or leave school out of shame, reducing their chances of securing a better life for themselves and their children.  Since its inception in 1996, the MCC has been helping girls who have dropped out of school to improve health, nutrition and education for themselves and their children and to acquire vocational skills for gainful employment and job creation.  \r\n\r\nVocational training programs include pre-school teacher training, catering, tailoring, hairdressing, crafts making and computer technology.   These youth achieve a vocational education in a very short period of 4-12 months and the programs are designed to suit the individual's basic needs for self reliance. \r\n\r\nThe Early childhood Centre caters to children aged 3-5 years.  It was created to provide play and early childhood education for the students’ children.  Currently the benefits are far reaching to other children in the community as well.  The Centre is run by the parents/guardians with support from Plan-Uganda.\r\n\r\nThe College has, since its inception, trained 600 young people, 80% of whom are employed, 20 % self employed in groups or as individuals.  With the little resources available we have strengthened the girls with the ability to overcome severe hardships resulting from the devastation of families by HIV pandemic and poverty. \r\n\r\nMirembe Community College - We release young women from despair into a life of dignity and purpose.  http://mirembecommunitycollege.info/\r\n.",

Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.
