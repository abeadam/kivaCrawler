Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

We believe that \r\nthis will damage the Field Partners in the long \r\nterm and impair their capacity to make loans to new borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe can't save every red loan, but we try to\r\nmake a difference as in the Starfish Story:\r\nhttp://67.199.70.191/articles/the-starfish-story.aspx\r\nHelp us fund loans we're already supporting:\r\nhttp://www.kiva.org/team/late_loaning_lenders/loans?status=fundRaising\r\n\r\n\r\nCheck out Charlotte's Web: http://starfish.dynalias.org\r\n\r\nThis watchlist for loans suggested by the team members (starfish + offlist) shows:\r\n* the current position in the popularity ranking (considering pages 1 to 5)\r\n* the timestamp of the most recent loan\r\n* the basket amount\r\nClick magnifier icon for more info.

                "description": "Alan's account of the founding of LLL is on the  team board @Alan re: #260143. Loans that are nearing expiry won't get funded if they don't get noticed. We look for loans that are about to expire by using the Sort By:\r\n\"Expiring Soon\" option instead of the default \"Popularity\", and then work to get them funded.\r\n\r\nSee our team FAQ, linked above (the \"Team Website\" button, next to our traffic light avatar).\r\n\r\nA Team LLL glossary (contributed by team member Tony):\r\n\r\nRed Loans: Loans that have less than five days to be funded, identifiable by the red box with the notice that says \"Only x days left!\" or \r\n\"Only x hours and y minutes left!\"\r\n\r\nLLL - Late Loaning Lenders: this team, where \r\nlenders work together to keep loans from \r\nexpiring.\r\n\r\nSFDD - Starfish Daily Dozen: Under current \r\npractice, one of these lists is prepared and \r\nposted for each day, to help LLL lenders focus \r\nand coordinate their lending on a targeted \r\ngroup of loans (the Starfish or SF). The lists \r\nare prepared by a group of volunteers who \r\nseek to be objective in selecting the loans to \r\nbe included in their lists. They also seek to \r\nspread out the loans in each list over a 24 hour \r\nperiod and to share the joy among the Field \r\nPartners with loans expiring during that period, \r\nbut their efforts are always constrained by the \r\nchoice of loans that are available for inclusion \r\nin the list. Loans with larger amounts needed \r\nwill be included in the period immediately after \r\neach Credit Day, when lenders are feeling \r\nflush, but the lists will become less ambitious \r\nwhen the LLL lenders are feeling poor.\r\n\r\nGG - Gorgeous Group: The SFDD list-makers usually add one or two of these loans at the end of the SF daily dozen lists. As the name \r\nimplies, only group loans are picked. When it is \r\nfirst posted, a typical GG loan will expire two \r\ndays or more after the list is posted. It will \r\nusually be retained as a GG until it becomes \r\nFully Funded or moves into Starfish range. The amount needed when the loan is selected as a GG will vary depending on the time of month.\r\n\r\nOPM - Abbreviation for \"other people's money.\"  Our main lending method is to coordinate LLL team members' loans, so that we make several loans to a borrower within a short period of time. This will move the borrower's loan request up in Kiva's \"popularity\" sort and get the loan noticed by other people (non-members of the LLL team).  Many loans then get their funding completed by loans from those non-LLL members.  By attracting other lenders' attention to our Starfish loans in this way, we multiply the impact of our finite funds, and save more loans from expiring than we otherwise could.\r\n\r\nRTR - Reduce the Red: These lists are \r\nprepared and posted when there are large \r\nnumbers of loans slated to expire in a short \r\nperiod of time. \"Red\" is a reference to the red \r\nboxes that are added to a loan description \r\nwhen the Loan is about to expire without full \r\nfunding.\r\n\r\nBulge: A short period in which a great many loans have their scheduled funding expiration times. This may happen when, for example, the volunteer coordinators at Kiva offer a promo of some kind to the editors & translators, to get them to do a lot of work in a very short period of time. Bulge loans are prime candidates for inclusion in Reduce the Red lists.\r\n\r\nBTB - Battling the Boxes: On those days where \r\nthere aren't 12 loans that qualify as \"Starfish,\" the listmakers will include loans that have their red boxes, but more than 24 hours left before their deadline, to make up the 12 loans for the list. The criteria are similar to SF \r\nloans, i.e., one per field partner and reasonable \r\namounts left to fund (not too much; not too \r\nlittle), except that these loans may have a longer time left before their expiry date. If they gain good traction on their first BTB day, they may be carried forward. If not ... they stand a second chance as SF.\r\n\r\nFF - Fully Funded: This is LLL code for a loan \r\nthat has received all the loans required for it to be removed from the list of loans that are raising funds \r\nand to move into paying back status.\r\n\r\nLars Ratio: the average funding per hour that is needed for a loan to become fully funded.\r\n(Developed by team member Lars)\r\n\r\nWiedergänger (contributed by Maria) - German expression, literal translation \"again walker,\" meaning \"undead,\" i.e. a person that has died but comes back, aka a zombie. Here it means a loan that disappears from the page, but comes back again because somebody didn't check out their basket.\r\n\r\nRuma sana (contributed by Jouko and Potkukelkka) - Finnish expression, literal translation \"ugly words.\"  It is a phrase to use when you are very frustrated, but want to stop just short of actual cursing -- for example, when the Kiva site repeatedly logs you out when you are trying to rescue an expiring loan at the last second.\r\n\r\nSee data about all loans currently fundraising on Kiva:\r\nwww.kivatools.com\r\nSee data about loans that have been mentioned on the LLL board, including the most recent lending activity on each loan:\r\nhttp://starfish.dynalias.org/\r\nSee loans in real time, as they are made:\r\nhttp://www.http://kivalive.com/index2.php\r\n\r\nLists are posted on the LLL Team message \r\nboard.

Although most of these loans are \r\npre-funded by the Field Partners, the Field\r\nPartners lose out on the capital if a loan\r\ndoesn't get funded on Kiva. We believe that \r\nthis will damage the Field Partners in the long \r\nterm and impair their capacity to make loans to new borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe can't save every red loan, but we try to\r\nmake a difference as in the Starfish Story:\r\nhttp://67.199.70.191/articles/the-starfish-story.aspx\r\nHelp us fund loans we're already supporting:\r\nhttp://www.kiva.org/team/late_loaning_lenders/loans?status=fundRaising\r\n\r\n\r\nCheck out Charlotte's Web: http://starfish.dynalias.org\r\n\r\nThis watchlist for loans suggested by the team members (starfish + offlist) shows:\r\n* the current position in the popularity ranking (considering pages 1 to 5)\r\n* the timestamp of the most recent loan\r\n* the basket amount\r\nClick magnifier icon for more info.

                "description": "Alan's account of the founding of LLL is on the  team board @Alan re: #260143. Loans that are nearing expiry won't get funded if they don't get noticed. We look for loans that are about to expire by using the Sort By:\r\n\"Expiring Soon\" option instead of the default \"Popularity\", and then work to get them funded.\r\n\r\nSee our team FAQ, linked above (the \"Team Website\" button, next to our traffic light avatar).\r\n\r\nA Team LLL glossary (contributed by team member Tony):\r\n\r\nRed Loans: Loans that have less than five days to be funded, identifiable by the red box with the notice that says \"Only x days left!\" or \r\n\"Only x hours and y minutes left!\"\r\n\r\nLLL - Late Loaning Lenders: this team, where \r\nlenders work together to keep loans from \r\nexpiring.\r\n\r\nSFDD - Starfish Daily Dozen: Under current \r\npractice, one of these lists is prepared and \r\nposted for each day, to help LLL lenders focus \r\nand coordinate their lending on a targeted \r\ngroup of loans (the Starfish or SF). The lists \r\nare prepared by a group of volunteers who \r\nseek to be objective in selecting the loans to \r\nbe included in their lists. They also seek to \r\nspread out the loans in each list over a 24 hour \r\nperiod and to share the joy among the Field \r\nPartners with loans expiring during that period, \r\nbut their efforts are always constrained by the \r\nchoice of loans that are available for inclusion \r\nin the list. Loans with larger amounts needed \r\nwill be included in the period immediately after \r\neach Credit Day, when lenders are feeling \r\nflush, but the lists will become less ambitious \r\nwhen the LLL lenders are feeling poor.\r\n\r\nGG - Gorgeous Group: The SFDD list-makers usually add one or two of these loans at the end of the SF daily dozen lists. As the name \r\nimplies, only group loans are picked. When it is \r\nfirst posted, a typical GG loan will expire two \r\ndays or more after the list is posted. It will \r\nusually be retained as a GG until it becomes \r\nFully Funded or moves into Starfish range. The amount needed when the loan is selected as a GG will vary depending on the time of month.\r\n\r\nOPM - Abbreviation for \"other people's money.\"  Our main lending method is to coordinate LLL team members' loans, so that we make several loans to a borrower within a short period of time. This will move the borrower's loan request up in Kiva's \"popularity\" sort and get the loan noticed by other people (non-members of the LLL team).  Many loans then get their funding completed by loans from those non-LLL members.  By attracting other lenders' attention to our Starfish loans in this way, we multiply the impact of our finite funds, and save more loans from expiring than we otherwise could.\r\n\r\nRTR - Reduce the Red: These lists are \r\nprepared and posted when there are large \r\nnumbers of loans slated to expire in a short \r\nperiod of time. \"Red\" is a reference to the red \r\nboxes that are added to a loan description \r\nwhen the Loan is about to expire without full \r\nfunding.\r\n\r\nBulge: A short period in which a great many loans have their scheduled funding expiration times. This may happen when, for example, the volunteer coordinators at Kiva offer a promo of some kind to the editors & translators, to get them to do a lot of work in a very short period of time. Bulge loans are prime candidates for inclusion in Reduce the Red lists.\r\n\r\nBTB - Battling the Boxes: On those days where \r\nthere aren't 12 loans that qualify as \"Starfish,\" the listmakers will include loans that have their red boxes, but more than 24 hours left before their deadline, to make up the 12 loans for the list. The criteria are similar to SF \r\nloans, i.e., one per field partner and reasonable \r\namounts left to fund (not too much; not too \r\nlittle), except that these loans may have a longer time left before their expiry date. If they gain good traction on their first BTB day, they may be carried forward. If not ... they stand a second chance as SF.\r\n\r\nFF - Fully Funded: This is LLL code for a loan \r\nthat has received all the loans required for it to be removed from the list of loans that are raising funds \r\nand to move into paying back status.\r\n\r\nLars Ratio: the average funding per hour that is needed for a loan to become fully funded.\r\n(Developed by team member Lars)\r\n\r\nWiedergänger (contributed by Maria) - German expression, literal translation \"again walker,\" meaning \"undead,\" i.e. a person that has died but comes back, aka a zombie. Here it means a loan that disappears from the page, but comes back again because somebody didn't check out their basket.\r\n\r\nRuma sana (contributed by Jouko and Potkukelkka) - Finnish expression, literal translation \"ugly words.\"  It is a phrase to use when you are very frustrated, but want to stop just short of actual cursing -- for example, when the Kiva site repeatedly logs you out when you are trying to rescue an expiring loan at the last second.\r\n\r\nSee data about all loans currently fundraising on Kiva:\r\nwww.kivatools.com\r\nSee data about loans that have been mentioned on the LLL board, including the most recent lending activity on each loan:\r\nhttp://starfish.dynalias.org/\r\nSee loans in real time, as they are made:\r\nhttp://www.http://kivalive.com/index2.php\r\n\r\nLists are posted on the LLL Team message \r\nboard.

Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

                "description": "In our team, we have a vision to change lives in novel ways. Our team's origin began with a Kiva Card (gift certificate) whose recipient founded this team. Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

Often there is little legislative protection, and developing countries are targeted. Trawling is compared to clear felling of forests. Old fish, which still reproduce are scooped up.  Ancient corals are destroyed. Our detailed knowledge of these areas is scant. Much is lost before it has even been described.[…]\r\n\r\nTHE DEL MAR MARINE SEEP, [http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/scienceshow/deep-sea-trenchjpg/5306970] only discovered in 2012 is not far from Scripps Institution of Oceanography in southern California. At 1020m it illustrates how little we know of the deep sea, right in the backyard of Scripps.  Bubbles emanat[ing] from the sea floor contain methane, a potent green house gas whose emissions from buried gas hydrates, may increase due to ocean warming, but could also represent a valuable energy source.  The colorful mats of bacteria may contain genetic resources of future use, while the reasons for rockfish use of this habitat remain unknown.  Margins like this one are often heavily trawled before discovery of unusual habitats like this methane seep.

As the current changes, so too do the habitats of marine creatures as the water temperature and salinity change.\r\n[…]\r\nStephanie Brodie: During the beginning of 2012, the waters off Hobart had a visitor which had never been seen before. This visitor was the popular yellowtail kingfish, a fish prized for its flesh and its fight. But why was this fish discovered almost 400 kilometres further south of its known range? The culprit is the East Australia Current, known as the EAC and made famous by the popular movie \"Finding Nemo.\" This ocean current runs along the east coast of Australia, shifting warm water from the Coral Sea towards Tasmania. Due to winds associated with climate change, the EAC has strengthened in recent years and is extending warmer and saltier waters further south, changing marine habitats along the way.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of new marine species to this south-eastern corner of Australia has not been uncommon in recent years and is a product of these shifting waters alternating oceanic habitats, resulting in remarkable ecosystem shifts and consequences for fisheries. The most commonly known example is the habitat expansion of the long-spined sea urchin, where this urchin habitat has expanded into Victorian and Tasmanian waters, resulting in loss of kelp habitat and affecting the multi-million-dollar abalone fisheries in these states. This is not an isolated case […]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HEALTH IMPLICATIONS OF FRACKING\r\n\r\nThe Lancet, Volume 383, Issue 9919, Pages 757 - 758, 1 March 2014\r\n[NB: this is copy-written material and is posted with utmost respect but without permission]\r\n\r\nexcerpted from http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2813%2962700-2/fulltext\r\n\r\nSari Kovats a, Michael Depledge b, Andy Haines a, Lora E Fleming c, Paul Wilkinson a, Seth B Shonkoff d e, Noah Scovronick a\r\n[…]\r\nFracking is at a very early stage in the UK, with only one shale gas well tested so far. This situation provides an important opportunity to gather information and to conduct studies of health and environmental effects before any large-scale development. Scientific study of the health effects of fracking is in its infancy, [1, 2] but findings suggest that this form of extraction might increase health risks compared with conventional oil and gas wells because of the larger surface footprints of fracking sites; their close proximity to locations where people live, work, and play; and the need to transport and store large volumes of materials. [3—6] In the USA, where more than 52 000 shale gas wells have been drilled, data suggest that risks of environmental contamination occur at all stages in the development of shale gas extraction. Failure of the structural integrity of the well cement and casing, [7] surface spills and leakage from above-ground storage, emissions from gas-processing equipment, and the large numbers of heavy transport vehicles involved are the most important factors that contribute to environmental contamination and exposures in the USA. [2]\r\n\r\nEnvironmental exposures include outdoor air pollutants (ie, volatile organic compounds, tropospheric ozone, and diesel particulate matter) [2] and pollutants (ie, benzene, hydrocarbons, endocrine-disrupting chemicals, and heavy metals) in both ground [8] and surface [9, 10] water. Known occupational hazards include airborne silica exposure at the well pad. [11] Toxicological data for the chemicals injected into wells (so-called frac fluid) indicate that many of them have known adverse effects on health, with no toxicological data available for some. [2] Assessment of potential risks has been difficult in the USA because drilling operators are not required to disclose which chemicals are used, but the UK Government has accepted the recommendation from the Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering Working Group on shale gas extraction [1] for full disclosure. [12] Exposure and epidemiological studies—of which there are currently very few—are needed along the entire supply chain of shale gas to characterise and quantify associated health issues. The socioeconomic implications of shale gas development on local communities before, during, and after extraction, and how risks should be communicated, are also important research priorities.

A 'PDF' refers to a \"partially diminished fraction of an ecosystem,\" and if your shampoo contains palm oil cultivated on clearcut jungle in Borneo, say, that value will be high. How about your shampoo's DALY? This measure comes from public health: \"disability adjusted life years,\" the amount of one's life that will be lost to a disabling disease because of, say, a liftetime's cumulative exposure to a given industrial chemical. So if your favorite shampoo contains two common ingredients, the carcinogen 1,4 dioxane, or BHA , an endocrine disrupter, its DALY will be higher.\r\n\r\nPDFs and DALYs are among myriad metrics for Anthropocene thinking, which views how human systems impact the global systems that sustain life. This way of perceiving interactions between the built and the natural worlds comes from the geological sciences. If adopted more widely this lens might usefully inform how we find solutions to the singular peril our species faces: the extinction of our ecological niche.

Not so much has been written about all that follows. It's the \"everything else\" that has turned a drilling technology into a land-and-water-devouring industry so vast that it's arguably one of the most pervasive extractive adventures in history.\r\n\r\nAccording to Cornell University's Anthony Ingraffea, the co-author of a study that established the global warming footprint of the industry, fracking \"involves much more than drill-the-well-frack-the-well-connect-the-pipeline-and-go-away.\" Almost all other industries \"occur in a zoned industrial area, inside of buildings, separated from home and farm, separated from schools.\" By contrast, the industry spawned by fracking \"permits the oil and gas industries to establish [their infrastructures] next to where we live. They are imposing on us the requirement to locate our homes, hospitals, and schools inside their industrial space.\"[…]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICINE, MONOPOLY AND MALICE\r\n\r\nStephanie Bartlett\r\n\r\nThe Lancet, Volume 381, Issue 9869, Page 795, 9 March 2013\r\nhttp://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2813%2960614-5/fulltext\r\n\r\ndoi:10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60614-5\r\n\r\nFIRE IN THE BLOOD\r\n\r\nDirected, produced, and written by Dylan Mohan Gray.

On general release in the UK http://fireintheblood.com\r\n\r\n“If it is true that one death is a tragedy, and a million deaths a statistic, then this is a story about statistics.” So begins 'Fire in the Blood,' a compelling documentary by Dylan Mohan Gray. There is, however, nothing remotely prosaic about this story. The film is a powerful exposé of the geopolitics of access to essential HIV medicines in the developing world. It is a David versus Goliath tale of how an unlikely coalition of people worldwide joined forces to fight against the patent monopolies of the world's biggest pharmaceutical conglomerates and secure the right to distribute low-cost antiretroviral drugs to those who need it most.\r\n\r\nMohan Gray gives an unapologetically raw view of the extent to which pharmaceutical companies blocked the sale of generic HIV treatment; in the film he makes the point that between 1996 and 2003, more than 10 million people are estimated to have died from HIV/AIDS in developing countries while life-saving antiretroviral drugs were transforming the lives of those in high-income nations. Patent laws in force at the time made it illegal to make, sell, or import low-cost generic drugs, while the annual price tag of up to about US$15 000 per patient put patented antiretrovirals far out of the reach of patients in poor countries.[…]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSomething of a hot topic now, for your attention.

They are overjoyed to discover human beings—including medical staff—smoking tobacco. “If they'll buy poison, they'll buy anything!” cackles one of the protagonists, smelling a profit.\r\n\r\nWhen future historians look back on the long and unhappy story of people and tobacco, what will be said about our current era? The American Lung Association's report, 'State of Tobacco Control 2012,' [http://www.stateoftobaccocontrol.org] gives some clues. In retrospect, it will seem incredible that 60 years after Richard Doll confirmed the link between smoking and lung cancer, and 40 years since a US President declared war on cancer, 2011 was “an abysmal year for tobacco control at the state level”. Comprehensive smoke-free laws were not passed by any state. In one—Nevada—they were weakened. Tobacco taxes were not raised, and smoking prevention programmes were cut. The litigiousness of the tobacco industry amazes now and will continue to amaze for decades to come. The report details the lawsuits that have been filed against the US Food and Drug Administration in an effort to hamper smoking prevention efforts, such as restricting sales to youths and adding graphic warning labels to cigarette packets. Where does the Federal Government stand? Although commendable in some areas—for example, in its ongoing efforts to implement the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act—it continues to dawdle over the submission of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control to the Senate, despite having signed it back in 2004.\r\n\r\nRenewed effort at State and Federal levels is needed to put tobacco where it belongs: in the history books, as a sad and strange episode in the story of human health. The colourful magazine advertisements of a few decades ago, featuring doctors endorsing cigarettes, seem alien to us now. Hopefully the current arguments over cigarette packaging and sales restriction will seem equally bizarre to future generations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEEP IT CLEAN: HOSPITAL ACQUIRED INFECTIONS IN CHILDREN\r\n\r\nNick Feasey and, Elizabeth Molyneux\r\nThe Lancet, Volume 378, Issue 9808, Pages 1982 - 1983, 10 December 2011\r\n\r\n\"Prevention of puerperal fever in hospital through hand-washing was described as long ago as the mid-19th century by Ignaz Semmelweis. During the past 20 years hospital-acquired infections have come to dominate the health system agenda[…]\r\n\r\n[…]the mortality from hospital-acquired bacteraemia is high at 53%, and the patients most affected are those who are malnourished or have a long hospital stay. Knowledge of the causes of such infections in Kilifi is helpful and it would be useful to know their antibiotic sensitivities to guide management in hospitals without blood-culture facilities. The findings in this study are likely to show only a small part of the problem; surgical-site and obstetric hospital-acquired infections are probably major problems in resource-poor settings and tuberculosis has much potential as a nosocomial agent in overcrowded wards with poor isolation facilities.\r\n\r\nWhat can be done to prevent hospital-acquired infections in resource-poor countries? Harbath and Gestmale report that 40% of nosocomial infections might be preventable. Simple hand-washing with soap and water has much potential to reduce cross infections.  In a malnutrition unit in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, the same bacteria were grown from the floor, beds, towels, and sinks as caused bloodstream infections in children staying in the ward. Hospitals need a culture of safety and awareness of infections; they also need an infection control committee to train staff and patients in infection prevention and to monitor results actively. Some hospital administrators might be unwilling to put money and effort into infection control because they do not think it will generate revenue. True, but control of hospital infections might go a long way towards reduction of costs.[…]\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2811%2961783-2/fulltext or, in pdf form, - http://download.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140673611617832.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICAL SCHOOLS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA\r\n\r\nCarsten Krüger  \r\nThe Lancet, Volume 378, Issue 9799, Pages 1293 - 1294, 8 October 2011\r\n\r\n\"[…]The practice of medicine not only involves biomedical science and knowledge, but it is also an art: the art of applying medical knowledge, the art of interaction with the patient, the art of judgment about what might be appropriate for a particular patient.

She was the ninth of ten children born into a farming family who grew teff (used to make the Ethiopian bread called injera), maize, and, most important of all, coffee. Lomita's family put a great emphasis on education and she went through secondary school with dreams of being a doctor. Her test scores, though, weren't high enough and she was unsure what to do.

In 2011, that day still seems some way off.…\"\r\n\r\n\"The problems in Toronto are mirrored in many modern metropolises. Tuberculosis finds its niche in poverty and social exclusion, with rates of disease in the most vulnerable and marginalised communities orders of magnitude higher than those in the general population. Homeless people are the engines of transmission because the two assumptions that hold true for the general population—that people with symptoms will seek medical help, and that they will take treatment as prescribed—simply do not hold in the homeless community.…\"\r\n\r\n\"Waiting in a hospital for the problem to come knocking on the door clearly does not work. But in New York City, a programme of active case finding, screening for latent disease, and access to intermediate care facilities that ensure treatment is adhered to, have helped to consistently reduce rates of active tuberculosis since the early 1990s. In London, the Find and Treat programme headed by Alistair Story has also made inroads.…\"\r\n\r\n\"But funding for Find and Treat is precarious, and is likely to become even more so if the move to commissioning led by general practitioners goes ahead as planned. New York City has shown that where there is political will, there is a way to tackle tuberculosis in homeless communities.

Last week saw Imperial Tobacco report increases in sales of cigarettes to Africa, the Middle East, and Asia Pacific. The company's share price rose steeply.

Analysts said forecasts that smoking was on the decline had been “overdone”.\r\n\r\n\"Go to Imperial Tobacco's website and you will find boasts that sales are up 10% in Saudi Arabia, Ukraine, and Russia.

Sign the petition now and share it with everyone -- when we reach one million signers we’ll deliver it to the South African government with unmissable and hard hitting actions.\"\r\n\r\nThe target, 1,000,000 signatures, currently at 947,750, is likely to be met soon.\r\n\r\nYou can help. Please sign the petition at this address - http://www.avaaz.org/en/stop_corrective_rape?fp \r\n\r\n\r\nPROTECTING CHILDREN BEING FORCED TO BEG: ENDING THE ABUSES BY TEACHERS IN SENEGAL'S SCHOOLS\r\n\r\n\"Senegalese authorities have begun to enforce a law prohibiting anyone from forcing a child to beg.[…]\" http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/11/24/protecting-children-being-forced-beg\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFLY AWAY CHILDREN\r\n\r\n\"Angelina Jolie may have fueled a boom in families wanting an Ethiopian child. Yet, thanks to opportunistic adoption agents and zero regulations, most African adoptions don't have a Hollywood ending.\" youtube.com/watch?v=iQoqih4iTss\r\n\r\n\"Ethiopia has 5 million orphans needing homes and the United States has millions of homes needing babies. Africa Correspondent Andrew Geoghegan and producer Mary Ann Jolley, discover it’s not a simple mathematical equation or zero sum game. There are virtually no government regulations or policing of the process. Many international adoption agencies flashing Christian credentials are taking advantage of the situation. Corruption, fraud and deception are rife.\" http://www.ethiotube.net/video/5801/Fly-Away-Children--Commercialization-of-Children\r\n\r\nFLY AWAY HOME\r\n\r\n\"How does it feel for a child who already has a family, to be adopted by strangers, never to go back home? Here's the harrowing reality behind the practices of some international adoption agencies. \r\n\r\nJournee Bradshaw was already thirteen and came from a large, middle-class Ethiopian family when she arrived in the US. She thought she was going on a trip abroad whilst her adoptive parents had been told she was only nine and destitute. But it was all a lie.\" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP8tD2T6QEY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking for a thinking read, thinking reed?\r\n\r\nHere's one. it's a forerunner to \"On What Matters,\" from Derek Parfit. \r\n\r\nEveryone should at least have a crack at \"Climbing the Mountain\" - it's a very good read but, fair warning, it's a fairly weight-e-tome @ three hundred plus pages…\r\n\r\nBut you'll dearly love the view if you do.
