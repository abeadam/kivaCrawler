Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

                "description": "We are fans of the most popular Greek pop star.\r\n\r\nSakis Rouvas Kiva Group has a new set a new goal: To reach 1000$ in loans by Sakis' birthday on the 5th of January. So far the total amount is 700$ and we are looking forward to your contribution thought the purpose of the site is not to \"donate\" exactly but more like help people help themselves. I think the video explains things better: http://youtu.be/meVAPscrGsI\r\n\r\nI know what you are thinking: \"Right now with the state the economy is in, it's definitely not a time for a move like this\". But you are wrong: This is precisly the time. A browse throught the site will convince you that you are in fact much richer than what you thought and you are not powerless against poverty. The pros of this site is:\r\n\r\n1) You don't actually give away your money. You will get them back! (the repayment rate is 98.65%)\r\n\r\n2) The loan start from 25.00 USD that is a very small amount. Check out http://www.xe.com/ucc/ to get the exact rate but anyway it's less than 20 euros. That's affordable even in the tightest budgets.\r\n\r\n3) Unlike all the other attempts it's easy to see how much money has been raised through the team http://www.kiva.org/team/sakis_rouvas_fans but that doesn't interfere with the return of the loan to your paypal account or with the process (you don't give the funds to a particular person in the group) Copy - pasting from the site: Kiva lenders who wish to lend as a group can form a lending team. This allows anyone on the team to see which borrowers other team members are lending to and allows you to track the impact that your group is making on Kiva.",
