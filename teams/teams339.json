Even sinners lend to sinners, to get back the same amount. But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return, and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, for he is kind to the ungrateful and the evil. Be merciful, even as your Father is merciful. “Judge not, and you will not be judged; condemn not, and you will not be condemned; forgive, and you will be forgiven; give, and it will be given to you. Good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, will be put into your lap. For with the measure you use it will be measured back to you.”",

We have the advantage to live in an intellectual and wealthy community. The initiative of doing something collateral started this Christmas period. Where there is time for some reflection and thoughts about the whereabouts of the underprivileged society.  \r\nAs I already mentioned we live in a more or less work hard & play hard culture, with lots of wining & dining and vacations. Just like the song: “We are the world, we are the children. We are the ones who make a brighter day, so let’s start giving”. It gives a good feeling if we can help other people throughout the world.\r\n\r\nOur fraternity (see below) established in the early nineties. Nearly every member started at the Amsterdam Academie, which is a university for “Banking and Insurance industry”. Consequently we have a major communal interest in economics. We believe Microfinance is a transparent way of being involved in charity. There are no extra costs for e.g. over-priced consultants. The ability of choosing your own projects is very interesting and above all, a very effective method to increase the standard of living. \r\n\r\nAll in all I wish we can get inspired by these business proposals provided by Kiva! Hoping Kiva becomes our partner in helping people all over the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nErik Beekmans\r\n",
                "description": "Heerendispuut AVE Amsterdam, is fraternity established in 1992, with around 30 members. After more then a decade, the intention of the group changed from a very active student society into a group of friends with shared interests. Besides some traditions like Christmas dinners and ski trips, we ceased acting as a usual fraternity, basically because we’re beyond our student period. ",

She raised 8 children under trying conditions. Despite many challenges, she was always able to extend comfort to others and set an extra plate even during times when there was little to share.   She is a matriarch, mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, caregiver, nurturer, and friend.  Our team is composed of  family, friends and admirers bound by our love for her.  We participate in Kiva to demonstrate our love and respect as well as to honour her \"spirit of generosity\" and her continuing role in our lives.",

                "description": "In the very heart of Central Asia lies a wonderful mountainous land – a country of Kyrgyzstan with the rich history that dates back to 201 BC. More than 80 ethnic groups live here, creating the variety of cultures and traditions. It serves as a trade crossroad and a trans-shipment point between the Europe and Asia as before when it used to be a connecting-link between north and south directions of Silk Way. \r\n\r\nThe economy of Kyrgyzstan was severely affected by the collapse of the Soviet trading block. More than 20% of the Kyrgyz population has left to other parts of the Soviet Union within past 10 years to seek work.\r\n\r\nWhile strong growth in neighboring Kazakhstan and China has created opportunities for expansion, Kyrgyzstan remains a small economy vulnerable to external shocks. Persistently high inflation, coupled with the global financial crisis, threatens to undermine recent improvements in poverty levels.",

Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.
