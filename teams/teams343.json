Since that time, the Building Learning Communities’ team has loaned $10.385.00 to struggling entrepreneurs around the world. We would like to invite you to help grow our team and have even more impact.\r\n\r\nKiva is a non-profit website that allows you to lend as little as $25 to a specific low-income entrepreneurs around the world. You choose who to lend to - whether a baker in Afghanistan, a goat herder in Uganda, a farmer in Peru, a restaurateur in Cambodia or a tailor in Iraq - and as they repay the loan, you get your money back. \r\n\r\nBy joining our lending team, we can work together to alleviate poverty.\r\n",
