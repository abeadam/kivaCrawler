Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

Since that time, the Building Learning Communities’ team has loaned $10.385.00 to struggling entrepreneurs around the world. We would like to invite you to help grow our team and have even more impact.\r\n\r\nKiva is a non-profit website that allows you to lend as little as $25 to a specific low-income entrepreneurs around the world. You choose who to lend to - whether a baker in Afghanistan, a goat herder in Uganda, a farmer in Peru, a restaurateur in Cambodia or a tailor in Iraq - and as they repay the loan, you get your money back. \r\n\r\nBy joining our lending team, we can work together to alleviate poverty.\r\n",

Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

Unfortunately many of Kiva borrowers rely on their retail business to earn a living- essentially becoming a middleman/woman and in a way only helping themselves and their family. In contrast, producers, makers and artisans create jobs, skilled workers and apprenticeship programs- to name a few- at the same time they spread entrepreneurial spirit, economic prosperity and sustainability for a large number of people.\r\nFrom making goods for basic necessities to technology or creating arts and crafts, all countries have something to offer. Let’s help entrepreneurs who want to help themselves and the people around them. Please join us and let’s make the world a better place through encouraging the spirit of producing, making and artisanship.",

We have the advantage to live in an intellectual and wealthy community. The initiative of doing something collateral started this Christmas period. Where there is time for some reflection and thoughts about the whereabouts of the underprivileged society.  \r\nAs I already mentioned we live in a more or less work hard & play hard culture, with lots of wining & dining and vacations. Just like the song: “We are the world, we are the children. We are the ones who make a brighter day, so let’s start giving”. It gives a good feeling if we can help other people throughout the world.\r\n\r\nOur fraternity (see below) established in the early nineties. Nearly every member started at the Amsterdam Academie, which is a university for “Banking and Insurance industry”. Consequently we have a major communal interest in economics. We believe Microfinance is a transparent way of being involved in charity. There are no extra costs for e.g. over-priced consultants. The ability of choosing your own projects is very interesting and above all, a very effective method to increase the standard of living. \r\n\r\nAll in all I wish we can get inspired by these business proposals provided by Kiva! Hoping Kiva becomes our partner in helping people all over the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nErik Beekmans\r\n",

After more then a decade, the intention of the group changed from a very active student society into a group of friends with shared interests. Besides some traditions like Christmas dinners and ski trips, we ceased acting as a usual fraternity, basically because we’re beyond our student period. ",
