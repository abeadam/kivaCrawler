She raised 8 children under trying conditions. Despite many challenges, she was always able to extend comfort to others and set an extra plate even during times when there was little to share.   She is a matriarch, mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, caregiver, nurturer, and friend.  Our team is composed of  family, friends and admirers bound by our love for her.  We participate in Kiva to demonstrate our love and respect as well as to honour her \"spirit of generosity\" and her continuing role in our lives.",

Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.
