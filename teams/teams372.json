Their parents are so poor they could never afford surgery. Being born with a cleft in a developing country is truly a curse, and no one knows how many newborns with clefts are killed or abandoned right after birth.  \r\n\r\nThrough Smile Train's free cleft surgery program, a 45 minute surgery gives these children a future and a second chance at life that they never thought they'd get. Let's change the world, one smile at a time!\r\n\r\nThrough our Kiva lending we want to raise awareness and support of the wonderful work Smile Train does in providing free cleft repair surgeries around the world. If our team logo is displayed on loans' top lending teams we hope other Kiva lenders will learn about Smile Train's work too.  Won't you join us?\r\n.\r\n",

Our team also includes staff members of Smile Train and Kiva and other microfinance ventures.  We would be happy for you to join our team too!\r\n\r\nThe little girl in our team logo is Pinki Sonkar.  She was born with a severe cleft into a family that was surviving on less than a dollar a day in a poor rural village in India. She could not go to school because the other children threw rocks at her.  Smile Pinki tells the story of how her life was changed forever by a free repair surgery at a Smile Train partner hospital.  Contact a team captain for more information if you would like a free DVD of this Academy Award winning documentary.\r\n\r\nWhere is Pinki Now - http://bit.ly/WhereisPinkiNow - This 5 minute video has interviews with Pinki's parents and teachers and video of Pinki in school.  You can see that cleft surgery brings a total transformation to the lives of these kids.\r\n\r\nWang Li Got Married - http://bit.ly/WangLi - this video tells the moving story of Smile Train's very first patient and how her life was totally changed.\r\n\r\nSmile Train in Mexico - http://bit.ly/SmileMexico - this video is for Adrián and the Arenal Group. As a team we loaned to help his parents, and we hope that through Smile Train Adrián will get the care that he needs.\r\n\r\nKiva Team Smile Train fund raiser page - http://bit.ly/DonateTeamSmileTrain - If you would like to make donation to support Smile Train's work you can do so here.

Jane cared deeply for those people who struggled as a result of not having adequate economic opportunities and were thus unable to meet their basic material needs.  As a result, she was devoted to expanding those opportunities.  Jane had a sophisticated understanding of capitalism.  She wanted capitalism to work better for the poor: that widespread poverty was (along with widespread environmental destruction) capitalism’s greatest failings.  Thus, she supported public policies and business practices that expanded opportunities for the income-poor.  She also believed strongly in helping small entrepreneurs to create new opportunities for themselves.  The Jane Skanderup Memorial Fund has been created to direct funds to small entrepreneurs in Latin America, with a preference to Mexicans and Peruvians because these were the Latin American people that Jane spent the most time with and knew the best.

I have volunteered to set up this fund in Jane's memory and have done so in collaboration with her family.  \r\n\r\nThere are three ways in which you can contribute to The Jane Skanderup Memorial Fund.  You can establish your own portfolio, browse the files of entrepreneurs seeking funds and make your own lending decisions that will then be counted as your own individual contribution and also as part of Jane's memorial fund.  Two, if you would like my assistance in helping you make lending decisions, feel free to contact me at redbeard_mt@yahoo.com and I will be happy to assist you in making your decisions.  Three, if you would like me to administer your funds, I would be happy to do so.  Just contact me via email and we can work out the details.",
