Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

Their parents are so poor they could never afford surgery. Being born with a cleft in a developing country is truly a curse, and no one knows how many newborns with clefts are killed or abandoned right after birth.  \r\n\r\nThrough Smile Train's free cleft surgery program, a 45 minute surgery gives these children a future and a second chance at life that they never thought they'd get. Let's change the world, one smile at a time!\r\n\r\nThrough our Kiva lending we want to raise awareness and support of the wonderful work Smile Train does in providing free cleft repair surgeries around the world. If our team logo is displayed on loans' top lending teams we hope other Kiva lenders will learn about Smile Train's work too.  Won't you join us?\r\n.\r\n",

Our team also includes staff members of Smile Train and Kiva and other microfinance ventures.  We would be happy for you to join our team too!\r\n\r\nThe little girl in our team logo is Pinki Sonkar.  She was born with a severe cleft into a family that was surviving on less than a dollar a day in a poor rural village in India. She could not go to school because the other children threw rocks at her.  Smile Pinki tells the story of how her life was changed forever by a free repair surgery at a Smile Train partner hospital.  Contact a team captain for more information if you would like a free DVD of this Academy Award winning documentary.\r\n\r\nWhere is Pinki Now - http://bit.ly/WhereisPinkiNow - This 5 minute video has interviews with Pinki's parents and teachers and video of Pinki in school.  You can see that cleft surgery brings a total transformation to the lives of these kids.\r\n\r\nWang Li Got Married - http://bit.ly/WangLi - this video tells the moving story of Smile Train's very first patient and how her life was totally changed.\r\n\r\nSmile Train in Mexico - http://bit.ly/SmileMexico - this video is for Adrián and the Arenal Group.

Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

We look for loans that are about to expire by using the Sort By:\r\n\"Expiring Soon\" option instead of the default \"Popularity\", and then work to get them funded.\r\n\r\nSee our team FAQ, linked above (the \"Team Website\" button, next to our traffic light avatar).\r\n\r\nA Team LLL glossary (contributed by team member Tony):\r\n\r\nRed Loans: Loans that have less than five days to be funded, identifiable by the red box with the notice that says \"Only x days left!\" or \r\n\"Only x hours and y minutes left!\"\r\n\r\nLLL - Late Loaning Lenders: this team, where \r\nlenders work together to keep loans from \r\nexpiring.\r\n\r\nSFDD - Starfish Daily Dozen: Under current \r\npractice, one of these lists is prepared and \r\nposted for each day, to help LLL lenders focus \r\nand coordinate their lending on a targeted \r\ngroup of loans (the Starfish or SF). The lists \r\nare prepared by a group of volunteers who \r\nseek to be objective in selecting the loans to \r\nbe included in their lists. They also seek to \r\nspread out the loans in each list over a 24 hour \r\nperiod and to share the joy among the Field \r\nPartners with loans expiring during that period, \r\nbut their efforts are always constrained by the \r\nchoice of loans that are available for inclusion \r\nin the list. Loans with larger amounts needed \r\nwill be included in the period immediately after \r\neach Credit Day, when lenders are feeling \r\nflush, but the lists will become less ambitious \r\nwhen the LLL lenders are feeling poor.\r\n\r\nGG - Gorgeous Group: The SFDD list-makers usually add one or two of these loans at the end of the SF daily dozen lists. As the name \r\nimplies, only group loans are picked. When it is \r\nfirst posted, a typical GG loan will expire two \r\ndays or more after the list is posted. It will \r\nusually be retained as a GG until it becomes \r\nFully Funded or moves into Starfish range. The amount needed when the loan is selected as a GG will vary depending on the time of month.\r\n\r\nOPM - Abbreviation for \"other people's money.\"  Our main lending method is to coordinate LLL team members' loans, so that we make several loans to a borrower within a short period of time. This will move the borrower's loan request up in Kiva's \"popularity\" sort and get the loan noticed by other people (non-members of the LLL team).  Many loans then get their funding completed by loans from those non-LLL members.  By attracting other lenders' attention to our Starfish loans in this way, we multiply the impact of our finite funds, and save more loans from expiring than we otherwise could.\r\n\r\nRTR - Reduce the Red: These lists are \r\nprepared and posted when there are large \r\nnumbers of loans slated to expire in a short \r\nperiod of time. \"Red\" is a reference to the red \r\nboxes that are added to a loan description \r\nwhen the Loan is about to expire without full \r\nfunding.\r\n\r\nBulge: A short period in which a great many loans have their scheduled funding expiration times. This may happen when, for example, the volunteer coordinators at Kiva offer a promo of some kind to the editors & translators, to get them to do a lot of work in a very short period of time. Bulge loans are prime candidates for inclusion in Reduce the Red lists.\r\n\r\nBTB - Battling the Boxes: On those days where \r\nthere aren't 12 loans that qualify as \"Starfish,\" the listmakers will include loans that have their red boxes, but more than 24 hours left before their deadline, to make up the 12 loans for the list. The criteria are similar to SF \r\nloans, i.e., one per field partner and reasonable \r\namounts left to fund (not too much; not too \r\nlittle), except that these loans may have a longer time left before their expiry date. If they gain good traction on their first BTB day, they may be carried forward. If not ... they stand a second chance as SF.\r\n\r\nFF - Fully Funded: This is LLL code for a loan \r\nthat has received all the loans required for it to be removed from the list of loans that are raising funds \r\nand to move into paying back status.\r\n\r\nLars Ratio: the average funding per hour that is needed for a loan to become fully funded.\r\n(Developed by team member Lars)\r\n\r\nWiedergänger (contributed by Maria) - German expression, literal translation \"again walker,\" meaning \"undead,\" i.e. a person that has died but comes back, aka a zombie. Here it means a loan that disappears from the page, but comes back again because somebody didn't check out their basket.\r\n\r\nRuma sana (contributed by Jouko and Potkukelkka) - Finnish expression, literal translation \"ugly words.\"  It is a phrase to use when you are very frustrated, but want to stop just short of actual cursing -- for example, when the Kiva site repeatedly logs you out when you are trying to rescue an expiring loan at the last second.\r\n\r\nSee data about all loans currently fundraising on Kiva:\r\nwww.kivatools.com\r\nSee data about loans that have been mentioned on the LLL board, including the most recent lending activity on each loan:\r\nhttp://starfish.dynalias.org/\r\nSee loans in real time, as they are made:\r\nhttp://www.http://kivalive.com/index2.php\r\nSee \"the fireworks\" when lending is very fast:\r\nhttp://www.kiva.org/live\r\n\r\nLists are posted on the LLL Team message \r\nboard.

Their parents are so poor they could never afford surgery. Being born with a cleft in a developing country is truly a curse, and no one knows how many newborns with clefts are killed or abandoned right after birth.  \r\n\r\nThrough Smile Train's free cleft surgery program, a 45 minute surgery gives these children a future and a second chance at life that they never thought they'd get. Let's change the world, one smile at a time!\r\n\r\nThrough our Kiva lending we want to raise awareness and support of the wonderful work Smile Train does in providing free cleft repair surgeries around the world. If our team logo is displayed on loans' top lending teams we hope other Kiva lenders will learn about Smile Train's work too.  Won't you join us?\r\n.\r\n",
                "description": "We are a diverse group of Kiva lenders from different backgrounds and different areas of the world who share a common desire to support the effort to bring a repair surgery to every child who needs one.  Our team also includes staff members of Smile Train and Kiva and other microfinance ventures.  We would be happy for you to join our team too!\r\n\r\nThe little girl in our team logo is Pinki Sonkar.  She was born with a severe cleft into a family that was surviving on less than a dollar a day in a poor rural village in India. She could not go to school because the other children threw rocks at her.  Smile Pinki tells the story of how her life was changed forever by a free repair surgery at a Smile Train partner hospital.  Contact a team captain for more information if you would like a free DVD of this Academy Award winning documentary.\r\n\r\nWhere is Pinki Now - http://bit.ly/WhereisPinkiNow - This 5 minute video has interviews with Pinki's parents and teachers and video of Pinki in school.  You can see that cleft surgery brings a total transformation to the lives of these kids.\r\n\r\nWang Li Got Married - http://bit.ly/WangLi - this video tells the moving story of Smile Train's very first patient and how her life was totally changed.\r\n\r\nSmile Train in Mexico - http://bit.ly/SmileMexico - this video is for Adrián and the Arenal Group. As a team we loaned to help his parents, and we hope that through Smile Train Adrián will get the care that he needs.\r\n\r\nKiva Team Smile Train fund raiser page - http://bit.ly/DonateTeamSmileTrain - If you would like to make donation to support Smile Train's work you can do so here.
