I'm so excited that this program is now being incorporated as part of several local school's monthly curriculum, lesson plans and group outreach programs.  Lending programs like KIVA are also an important part of these positive social caring projects.\r\n\r\nWe hope to inspire children to be active participants in their communities.  And isn't the world one large community?  \r\n\r\nChildren are generous by nature and are starting to be proactive and fire up amazing changes on their own.  Children of all ages are really wanting to help other people around the world- and are looking for ways to make a powerful impact.  Kiva is perfect!  With the help of their families and their community, just imagine what they can do!\r\n\r\nGrowing, sharing, learning, loving and giving are all part of what we want to instill and support in our children.

They have close ties with community leaders, in various tribes and regions and aligns their work with the needs of the communities, therefore going into isolated hill regions where other forms of capital are not available.   They lend to women over the age of 55, which is unusual for microlending organizations in India.   They provide clients with loans to purchase solar lamps, which is especially impactful because most of the areas WSDS works in do not have electricity. Political unrest and frequent economic blockades in the area make it very difficult to provide services, resulting in Manipur having the lowest penetration of financial services in the country.",
