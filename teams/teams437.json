It is our belief that as we foster entrepreneurship, economic prosperity follows, more jobs are created, and poverty is reduced. Meanwhile the individual gains financial independence, an essential key to individual freedom. Neither reduction in poverty or individual freedom were the original goals of the entrepreneur, but they are the unintended consequences from which all of us benefit.",
