The company is again investing about $100 million in education in 2009. Over the last decade, Intel has invested over $1 billion and Intel employees have donated more than 2 million hours towards improving education in 50 countries.  \r\nIndividuals can provide support and find more information about the Small Things Challenge – including the online petition and a video featuring musicians and actors who support the cause – at www.smallthingschallenge.com.
