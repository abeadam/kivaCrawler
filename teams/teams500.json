Although most of these loans are \r\npre-funded by the Field Partners, the Field\r\nPartners lose out on the capital if a loan\r\ndoesn't get funded on Kiva. We believe that \r\nthis will damage the Field Partners in the long \r\nterm and impair their capacity to make loans to new borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe can't save every red loan, but we try to\r\nmake a difference as in the Starfish Story:\r\nhttp://67.199.70.191/articles/the-starfish-story.aspx\r\nHelp us fund loans we're already supporting:\r\nhttp://www.kiva.org/team/late_loaning_lenders/loans?status=fundRaising\r\n\r\n\r\nCheck out Charlotte's Web: http://starfish.dynalias.org\r\n\r\nThis watchlist for loans suggested by the team members (starfish + offlist) shows:\r\n* the current position in the popularity ranking (considering pages 1 to 5)\r\n* the timestamp of the most recent loan\r\n* the basket amount\r\nClick magnifier icon for more info.

                "description": "Alan's account of the founding of LLL is on the  team board @Alan re: #260143. Loans that are nearing expiry won't get funded if they don't get noticed. We look for loans that are about to expire by using the Sort By:\r\n\"Expiring Soon\" option instead of the default \"Popularity\", and then work to get them funded.\r\n\r\nSee our team FAQ, linked above (the \"Team Website\" button, next to our traffic light avatar).\r\n\r\nA Team LLL glossary (contributed by team member Tony):\r\n\r\nRed Loans: Loans that have less than five days to be funded, identifiable by the red box \r\nwith the notice that says \"Only x days left!\" or \r\n\"Only x hours and y minutes left!\"\r\n\r\nLLL - Late Loaning Lenders: this team, where \r\nlenders work together to keep loans from \r\nexpiring.\r\n\r\nSFDD - Starfish Daily Dozen: Under current \r\npractice, one of these lists is prepared and \r\nposted for each day, to help LLL lenders focus \r\nand coordinate their lending on a targeted \r\ngroup of loans (the Starfish or SF). The lists \r\nare prepared by a group of volunteers who \r\nseek to be objective in selecting the loans to \r\nbe included in their lists. They also seek to \r\nspread out the loans in each list over a 24 hour \r\nperiod and to share the joy among the Field \r\nPartners with loans expiring during that period, \r\nbut their efforts are always constrained by the \r\nchoice of loans that are available for inclusion \r\nin the list. Loans with larger amounts needed \r\nwill be included in the period immediately after \r\neach Credit Day, when lenders are feeling \r\nflush, but the lists will become less ambitious \r\nwhen the LLL lenders are feeling poor.\r\n\r\nGG - Gorgeous Group: The SFDD list-makers have the option of adding one or two of these \r\nloans after their SFDD lists. As the name \r\nimplies, only group loans are picked. When it is \r\nfirst posted, a typical GG loan will expire two \r\ndays or more after the list is posted. It will \r\nusually be retained as a GG until it becomes \r\nFully Funded or moves into Starfish range. The amount needed when the loan is selected as a GG will vary depending on the time of month.\r\n\r\nOPM - Abbreviation for \"other people's money.\"  Our main lending method is to coordinate LLL team members' loans, so that we make several loans to a borrower within a short period of time. This will move the borrower's loan request up in Kiva's \"popularity\" sort and get the loan noticed by other people (non-members of the LLL team).  Many loans then get their funding completed by loans from those non-LLL members.  By attracting other lenders' attention to our Starfish loans in this way, we multiply the impact of our finite funds, and save more loans from expiring than we otherwise could.\r\n\r\nRTR - Reduce the Red: These lists are \r\nprepared and posted when there are large \r\nnumbers of loans slated to expire in a short \r\nperiod of time. \"Red\" is a reference to the red \r\nboxes that are added to a loan description \r\nwhen the Loan is about to expire without full \r\nfunding.\r\n\r\nBTB - Battling the Boxes: On those days where \r\nthere aren't 12 loans that qualify as \"Starfish,\" \r\nthe listmakers will include BTB loans to help \r\nfocus attention on the red-boxed loans with the best chances. The criteria are similar to SF \r\nloans, i.e., one per field partner and reasonable \r\namounts left to fund (not too much; not too \r\nlittle), except that these loans may have a longer time left before their expiry date. If they gain good traction on their first BTB day, they may be carried forward. If not ... they stand a second chance as SF.\r\n\r\nBulge: A short period in which a great many \r\nloans have their scheduled funding expiration \r\ntimes. Bulges come about primarily when a \r\nField Partner (FP) submits an amount of loans \r\nto Kiva than is greater than the FP's quota. The loan \r\ndescriptions are prepared for posting by \r\ntranslating the loan descriptions (if necessary) \r\nand editing them, and they are then held in a queue by Kiva's server, to be posted when the FP has freed up some of its credit limit on Kiva, by making some repayments. Bulge loans are prize candidates for inclusion \r\nin Reduce the Red lists.\r\n\r\nFF - Fully Funded: This is LLL code for a loan \r\nthat has received all the loans required for it to be removed from the list of loans that are raising funds \r\nand to move into paying back status.\r\n\r\nLars Ratio: the average funding per hour that is needed for a loan to become fully funded.\r\n(Developed by team member Lars)\r\n\r\nWiedergänger (contributed by Maria) - German expression, literal translation \"again walker,\" meaning \"undead,\" i.e. a person that has died but comes back, aka a zombie. Here it means a loan that disappears from the page, but comes back again because somebody didn't check out their basket.\r\n\r\nRuma sana (contributed by Jouko and Potkukelkka) - Finnish expression, literal translation \"ugly words.\"  It is a phrase to use when you are very frustrated, but want to stop just short of actual cursing -- for example, when the Kiva site repeatedly logs you out when you are trying to rescue an expiring loan at the last second.\r\n\r\nSee data about all loans currently fundraising on Kiva:\r\nwww.kivatools.com\r\nSee data about loans that have been mentioned on the LLL board, including the most recent lending activity on each loan:\r\nhttp://starfish.dynalias.org/\r\nSee loans in real time, as they are made:\r\nhttp://www.http://kivalive.com/index2.php\r\n\r\nLists are posted on the LLL Team message \r\nboard.

We're dedicated to bringing the joy and learning of baseball to young people in Cambodia. \r\n_________________________________________________\r\n\r\nHere is Joe's story in his own words: \r\n\r\n \"Hello, I'm Joe Cook, Cambodian-American, 35 years old married with two children. I have worked as a chef for over 15 years and currently work at the Mikata Japanese Steakhouse in Dothan, Alabama. I first fell in love with baseball when I came to America at 12 years old. \r\n\r\nEscaping to America\r\n\r\n\"During the 1970s, Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge began brutally enforcing radical communism. Mass executions, starvation and disease killed more than two million Cambodians - including my father and two younger sisters. \r\n\r\n\"Land mines and other wire mines also killed over 80,000 people and wounded 900,000 more. I was one of those wounded by a wire tree mine. \r\n\r\n\"Since the day I was born in 1970, I experienced suffering due to war, poverty, illness and no education. After my father was killed, my family was sent to work in labor camps - and in 1976 three of my sisters were separated and lost. In late 1978, when I was eight years old, my mother, oldest brother and me escaped from our camp and began a journey to the Thailand border. \r\n\r\n\"We walked and ran bare foot for four days and three nights. I was starved and exhausted and near death, following my accident with the tree wire mine, but we made it to the border. And, after four miraculous years in refugee camps, we came to Chattanooga, Tennessee on May 13, 1983. \r\n\r\n\"I am very lucky and proud to be in America. \r\n\r\nTraveling back to Cambodia \r\n\r\n \"Nearly twenty years after coming to America, I heard that my sister was alive and I went back to Cambodia to reunite with her and her family in May 2002. \r\n\r\n\"While I was there, my niece and nephew took me to see their school and friends. \r\n\r\n\"After seeing the school, I knew what I must do to help the children and the school. I told them that when I came back I would bring baseball and school supplies. \r\n\r\n\"No one had ever heard anything about baseball before - and had no idea what I was talking about. At the time, I had no equipment to show them so I promised that when I came back to Cambodia I would bring some. \r\n\r\n \"A few weeks later, back in Dothan, Alabama I began collecting school and baseball equipment to send to those children in Cambodia. And I am extremely grateful to the those who helped me collect these supplies. \r\n\r\nBaseball is born in Cambodia \r\n\r\n\"In November 2002, I returned to Cambodia as promised with gifts for the children and donations of school and baseball equipment for the MeasChum school in the city Baribo, 68 miles west of Phnom Penh. \r\n\r\n\"Over the following days, I helped the children build Cambodia's first baseball field. And on November 26, 2002 baseball was 'born' in Cambodia and I officially introduced it to people for the first time. \r\n\r\n\"I taught the children and teachers how to pitch, throw, catch, hit and run the bases. They soon got the idea - and I was so happy to see children playing baseball for the first in Cambodia. \r\n\r\n\"In Baribo, baseball has grown into a very popular sport. More and more children and adults have gotten involved. Some players had walked over three days to play or learn baseball. \r\n\r\n \"Within five months, the people and the Mayor of Baribo donated land to build a second ballpark called Koom Baseball Field. \r\n\r\n\"Baseball equipment is hard to come by for these players and many play with bare feet and no gear. Baseballs, themselves, are in limited supply too. And never thrown away regardless of their condition. I am always looking for extra equipment. And, now, there are more than 50 schools that would love to participate. \r\n\r\nCoaching Baseball from a world away \r\n\r\n\"Since 2002, I have been coaching baseball from across the globe - via the internet. \r\n\r\n\"Every night in Dothan (Cambodia is 12 hours ahead), I go online to communicate with those who run the programs for me in Cambodia. \r\n\r\n On my off days from the restaurant, I go to local high schools and ballparks to videotape baseball games to send to Cambodia. these tapes are a great teaching tool for the players. \r\n\r\n\"Bringing baseball to Cambodia is my passion. And I am determined to help others have a better life. \r\n\r\n\"Thanks to generous support from people like you, we are making progress. But I am hopeful we can do much more. Today, we're working to raise funds to create two new ball fields in the provinces of Kompong Chnang and Kompong Cham. And we're always collecting baseball gear\". \r\n\r\n\r\nIf you would like to learn more about how you or your organization can make a donation, please contact us at joe@cambodiabaseball.org or joecook_@hotmail.com.
