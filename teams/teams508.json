Their parents are so poor they could never afford surgery. Being born with a cleft in a developing country is truly a curse, and no one knows how many newborns with clefts are killed or abandoned right after birth.  \r\n\r\nThrough Smile Train's free cleft surgery program, a 45 minute surgery gives these children a future and a second chance at life that they never thought they'd get. Let's change the world, one smile at a time!\r\n\r\nThrough our Kiva lending we want to raise awareness and support of the wonderful work Smile Train does in providing free cleft repair surgeries around the world. If our team logo is displayed on loans' top lending teams we hope other Kiva lenders will learn about Smile Train's work too.  Won't you join us?\r\n.\r\n",

Our team also includes staff members of Smile Train and Kiva and other microfinance ventures.  We would be happy for you to join our team too!\r\n\r\nThe little girl in our team logo is Pinki Sonkar.  She was born with a severe cleft into a family that was surviving on less than a dollar a day in a poor rural village in India. She could not go to school because the other children threw rocks at her.  Smile Pinki tells the story of how her life was changed forever by a free repair surgery at a Smile Train partner hospital.  Contact a team captain for more information if you would like a free DVD of this Academy Award winning documentary.\r\n\r\nWhere is Pinki Now - http://bit.ly/WhereisPinkiNow - This 5 minute video has interviews with Pinki's parents and teachers and video of Pinki in school.  You can see that cleft surgery brings a total transformation to the lives of these kids.\r\n\r\nWang Li Got Married - http://bit.ly/WangLi - this video tells the moving story of Smile Train's very first patient and how her life was totally changed.\r\n\r\nSmile Train in Mexico - http://bit.ly/SmileMexico - this video is for Adrián and the Arenal Group. As a team we loaned to help his parents, and we hope that through Smile Train Adrián will get the care that he needs.\r\n\r\nKiva Team Smile Train fund raiser page - http://bit.ly/DonateTeamSmileTrain - If you would like to make donation to support Smile Train's work you can do so here.

Students organize chapters to join with like-minded students in their community and\r\naround the country to raise money to battle poverty, not with sympathy, but with business transactions rooted in mutual dignity. Kiva U is guided by\r\nthese goals, which we affirm to be our mission:\r\n\r\n • To inspire awareness of global issues, especially poverty and hunger;\r\n\r\n• To bring together and subsequently organize students interested in fighting\r\npoverty;\r\n\r\n• To encourage interest in microfinance as a tool to combat poverty;\r\n\r\n• To raise money to invest in worthy entrepreneurs in developing states,\r\ncountering the predatory loaning practices so prevalent among the world's poorest regions;\r\n\r\n• To develop in its members a sense of global responsibility;\r\n\r\n• To enable others to become more aware of global issues such as poverty\r\nand help them realize the power of microfinance;\r\n\r\n• To establish a network of high school chapters around the country in which\r\nthis organization will be a central resource;\r\n\r\n• To allow high school students to play a direct role in alleviating global\r\npoverty through loans to entrepreneurs in the developing world.",
