Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

This is a forum to notify each other of environmentally sustainable loans that are needing funding. Sustainable development projects include recycling, solar, re-use, organic agriculture, health, etc. \r\n\r\nWe support enterprises that care about the earth and all of its inhabitants. We have no religious, racial or political affiliations of any kind. We want to encourage sustainable enterprises that recycle, reuse, repurpose and use environmentally sound agricultural and manufacturing practices. \r\nMany of us would like Kiva to develop environmental standards or criteria for their lending practices to prevent environmental impacts that would increase poverty for future generations.\r\nMany people want to have a green portfolio, or at least a green component. \r\nWon't you join us in creating true sustainability that includes a healthy environment?",

Their parents are so poor they could never afford surgery. Being born with a cleft in a developing country is truly a curse, and no one knows how many newborns with clefts are killed or abandoned right after birth.  \r\n\r\nThrough Smile Train's free cleft surgery program, a 45 minute surgery gives these children a future and a second chance at life that they never thought they'd get. Let's change the world, one smile at a time!\r\n\r\nThrough our Kiva lending we want to raise awareness and support of the wonderful work Smile Train does in providing free cleft repair surgeries around the world. If our team logo is displayed on loans' top lending teams we hope other Kiva lenders will learn about Smile Train's work too.  Won't you join us?\r\n.\r\n",
                "description": "We are a diverse group of Kiva lenders from different backgrounds and different areas of the world who share a common desire to support the effort to bring a repair surgery to every child who needs one.  Our team also includes staff members of Smile Train and Kiva and other microfinance ventures.  We would be happy for you to join our team too!\r\n\r\nThe little girl in our team logo is Pinki Sonkar.  She was born with a severe cleft into a family that was surviving on less than a dollar a day in a poor rural village in India. She could not go to school because the other children threw rocks at her.  Smile Pinki tells the story of how her life was changed forever by a free repair surgery at a Smile Train partner hospital.  Contact a team captain for more information if you would like a free DVD of this Academy Award winning documentary.\r\n\r\nWhere is Pinki Now - http://bit.ly/WhereisPinkiNow - This 5 minute video has interviews with Pinki's parents and teachers and video of Pinki in school.  You can see that cleft surgery brings a total transformation to the lives of these kids.\r\n\r\nWang Li Got Married - http://bit.ly/WangLi - this video tells the moving story of Smile Train's very first patient and how her life was totally changed.\r\n\r\nSmile Train in Mexico - http://bit.ly/SmileMexico - this video is for Adrián and the Arenal Group. As a team we loaned to help his parents, and we hope that through Smile Train Adrián will get the care that he needs.\r\n\r\nKiva Team Smile Train fund raiser page - http://bit.ly/DonateTeamSmileTrain - If you would like to make donation to support Smile Train's work you can do so here.

Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

Now we are continuing our involvement with Turame in an even more hands-on-way - by becoming microfinance lenders. \r\n\r\nHow to get involved:\r\n1. Click the join team button to the left [if you are new to Kiva you will need to create an account].\r\n\r\n2. Choose a Borrower: Check out the current Turame loans by scrolling down at this link: [http://bit.ly/pGU0sd] If there are no new loans, check back in as Turame posts new loans twice a month.\r\n\r\n3. Make a Loan:\r\n\r\n4. Get Repaid: Over the course of 6 months your loan will get repaid to you in the form of Kiva credit. [This is a loan, not a donation]\r\n\r\n5. Repeat.  You can take the money and put it back in your pocket or make a loan to another group.\r\n\r\nThanks for helping support Turame Community Finance in providing loans to those living in one of the poorest countries on the planet. \r\nYou can learn more about Turame here: www.kiva.org/partners/162",

While the reasons girls drop out of school are complex, it is clear that pregnancy and parenting responsibilities are a significant factor, and the economic consequences of dropping out of school are devastating for these teen mothers, their children, and their communities. \r\n\r\nOften, girls that become pregnant in school are expelled or leave school out of shame, reducing their chances of securing a better life for themselves and their children.  Since its inception in 1996, the MCC has been helping girls who have dropped out of school to improve health, nutrition and education for themselves and their children and to acquire vocational skills for gainful employment and job creation.  \r\n\r\nVocational training programs include pre-school teacher training, catering, tailoring, hairdressing, crafts making and computer technology.   These youth achieve a vocational education in a very short period of 4-12 months and the programs are designed to suit the individual's basic needs for self reliance. \r\n\r\nThe Early childhood Centre caters to children aged 3-5 years.  It was created to provide play and early childhood education for the students’ children.  Currently the benefits are far reaching to other children in the community as well.  The Centre is run by the parents/guardians with support from Plan-Uganda.\r\n\r\nThe College has, since its inception, trained 600 young people, 80% of whom are employed, 20 % self employed in groups or as individuals.  With the little resources available we have strengthened the girls with the ability to overcome severe hardships resulting from the devastation of families by HIV pandemic and poverty. \r\n\r\nMirembe Community College - We release young women from despair into a life of dignity and purpose.  http://mirembecommunitycollege.info/\r\n.",

Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

Kudos to Kiva.org that allows us to connect for this common cause.",
                "description": "In our team, we have a vision to change lives in novel ways. Our team's origin began with a Kiva Card (gift certificate) whose recipient founded this team. Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.
