We dance Sardanes and sing Habaneres. We eat Calçots, Paella, Escudella, Allioli, Panellets, Crema Catalana, Mato, and pa amb tomàquet. La Costa Brava, la Costa Daurada, l'Empordà, els Pirineus... all of them are beautiful places from Catalunya. We live by the Mediterranean sea. We like sports (Barça and Espanyol are two good examples). We believe in people, and thus we like to see how Sagrada Família is being built thanks to the backing of many people. We are ruled by the Generalitat and we drink from the Muga, Fluvià, Ter, Ebre, Llobregat, Besos, Anoia, Segre, Noguera, and we like hiking in Collserola, Tibidabo, Montjuïc, Montserrat, la Pica d'Estats. We ride at Montmelo F1 circuit, we produce Cava and wine in serveral areas (Montsant, Vallès, Alella, Conca de Barbera, Costers del Segre, Emporda, Penedes, Pla de Bages, Priorat i la Terra Alta).

Persistently high inflation, coupled with the global financial crisis, threatens to undermine recent improvements in poverty levels.",
