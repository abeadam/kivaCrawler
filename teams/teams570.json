Most of our parents immigrated to the United States with little money and no knowledge of the culture and language.  But they had big dreams of creating a better life for themselves and their families.  Many of them were able to build success and provide for us through managing their own small businesses.  Now, it is our turn.  Many of us have begun our own families and are entrepreneurs ourselves.  Every year, we gather together to celebrate the holidays and every year, we find that our family has grown and expanded.  In 2009, we decided to expand in a new way and include members of our global, human family in the celebrations.  We sought to find those who, despite differences in culture and language, shared our family’s spirit of entrepreneurship.  We know the sense of pride and strength that comes from the ability to provide for ourselves and our families and want to pass along that tradition to a new generation of entrepreneurs.  So, welcome to our family!",

Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.
