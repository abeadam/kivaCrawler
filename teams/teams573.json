                "description": "(Note: this team was formerly called \"Kiva High School\")\r\n\r\nKiva U Schools is an international network of students and their\r\nrespective chapters, unified by a belief that poverty can be alleviated and that\r\nmicrofinance is an effective tool to achieve this end. Students organize chapters to join with like-minded students in their community and\r\naround the country to raise money to battle poverty, not with sympathy, but with business transactions rooted in mutual dignity. Kiva U is guided by\r\nthese goals, which we affirm to be our mission:\r\n\r\n • To inspire awareness of global issues, especially poverty and hunger;\r\n\r\n• To bring together and subsequently organize students interested in fighting\r\npoverty;\r\n\r\n• To encourage interest in microfinance as a tool to combat poverty;\r\n\r\n• To raise money to invest in worthy entrepreneurs in developing states,\r\ncountering the predatory loaning practices so prevalent among the world's poorest regions;\r\n\r\n• To develop in its members a sense of global responsibility;\r\n\r\n• To enable others to become more aware of global issues such as poverty\r\nand help them realize the power of microfinance;\r\n\r\n• To establish a network of high school chapters around the country in which\r\nthis organization will be a central resource;\r\n\r\n• To allow high school students to play a direct role in alleviating global\r\npoverty through loans to entrepreneurs in the developing world.",

The company is again investing about $100 million in education in 2009. Over the last decade, Intel has invested over $1 billion and Intel employees have donated more than 2 million hours towards improving education in 50 countries.  \r\nIndividuals can provide support and find more information about the Small Things Challenge – including the online petition and a video featuring musicians and actors who support the cause – at www.smallthingschallenge.com.
