Abdusattor drove a car for a living, but he wanted a loan to begin selling watermelons. Meanwhile, Mirmahmud sold watermelons, but he wanted a loan to purchase a car. When these loans posted on the same day, we knew that we had to get them together!  Cars and watermelons? They go together in ways we never would have imagined!\r\n\r\nIn the developing world, entrepreneurs sometimes wind up in unlikely professions or combining businesses  that we might not ordinarily expect to go together.  Through such immprobable business combinations, these entrepreneuers have found ways to be successful by filling the unique needs of their communities. \r\n\r\nThis team  celebrates all of the wonderful and unlikely enterprises and pairings of enterprises that Kiva borrowers are involved in. Of course, we have a special soft spot for \"watermelon+car\" loans.  Also, we like alliteration.\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nMore details about our first two borrowers can be found here.\r\nAbdusattor: www.kiva.org/lend/456025\r\nMirmahmud: www.kiva.org/lend/455461\r\n\r\nImages of wheeled watermelons adapted from http://foodstylin.com/gallery.asp?gal=6&tp=img&id=66 & http://www.offbeatearth.com/watermelon-car/",

Someone who is living a difficult situation, maybe one that is really dramatic? \r\n\r\nEvery time you travel, you have a chance to encounter unfortunate conditions that are benefiting from local non-profit organizations working  in the background.\r\n\r\nEvery day.\r\n\r\nSo why don’t you take advantage of your trip to give a little piece of a dream to someone who needs your contribution?\r\n\r\nYour trip will become more meaningful, your horizon will be widened, the hopes of others become your own.\r\n\r\nOur names are Domenico and Giulia and we are speaking out of experience. Because we do this on a regular basis. \r\n\r\nHow is it done? Before you leave, organise a little collection of funds among your friends and relatives. If you are the kind of person who is very organised and leaves nothing to chance, look for and choose a local organization before your departure. Otherwise, you can find one wherever you choose to go. There are schools, orphanages, hospitals, medical centres and associations filled with volunteers who are fighting against hunger, war and illness every day. Meeting these volunteers is an experience that will paint any trip with the colours of humanity. And it will become a memorable trip. \r\n\r\nCome on, participate. Record your trip with videos and photographs and let us know about the associations that you helped. Getting the word out about their work through their internet sites is a small, yet great contribution.\r\nAnd remember, to quote Einstein: “ we must become champions of humanity”…\r\n",
                "description": "Kiss From The World is a unique online magazine packed with videos and photos taken all over the world, extraordinary journeys and one-of-a-kind encounters.\r\n\r\nKiss From The World makes you the traveller, taking you to the heart of the action, into the depths of forests, to interviews with hardened gang leaders, into a world of unknown tribes, war zones, exotic parties…\r\n\r\nBut it also takes you on a journey into daily life, and the extraordinary normality of the world.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nKiss From The World, the people\r\n\r\nThe idea for the magazine came to life in 2007 when Domenico Pacifico, photojournalist, started sharing online his exclusive reportage. Domenico and his partner Giulia travel the globe, documenting their journeys and the people they meet.\r\n\r\nTo travel, to film, to photograph: Domenico’s techniques as a reporter and his curiosity as a traveller to discover the cultures, ethnicities and religions of the people he meets means he can bring all of these strands together on his website. You might not notice the people in his videos and photos if you pass them on the street. Here, they become vivid and real. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nKiss From The World, the channels\r\n\r\niPeople: on Kiss From The World, places matter, but above all, people matter, as this channel shows. iPeople is rich with stirring encounters with men and women who are all special in their worlds and their daily lives.\r\n\r\nTribe tells the story of meetings in the depths of forests, far from civilization, and of different ways of living, even when surprisingly near major urban areas.\r\n\r\nDanger Zone tells stories of areas best avoided by the traveller. It speaks of dangerous neighbourhoods, countries at war, and realities where the people are rootless, and there is no law.\r\n\r\nSexy World is a journey into the “hottest” places on the globe. Take a dip in a world of parties and overwhelming sensuality.\r\n\r\nAnd then there’s Kaleidoscope – quite simply photos and music, and Post-it - images without comments.\r\n\r\nAnimals takes you on a journey into natural habitats and reserves, to discover surprising aspects of animal life, told by the people who observe them every day - either for passion or profession.\r\n\r\nAnd then there’s Travel & help, where you’ll find out about the most vulnerable people that Domenico and Giulia met and helped during their journeys, either directly or via small local organizations.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nKiss From The World, minute by minute\r\n\r\nOn Kiss From The World, take a journey with travellers and experience it as if in real-time.\r\n\r\nTravel Book is a collection of travel journals packed with thousands of photos and minute by minute annotations.\r\n\r\nWhat’s Up - snippets and tasters of what’s to come next in the magazine.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nKiss From The World: the users - reporters like us!\r\n\r\nKiss From The World readers have the chance to become part of an even bigger journey. Tell us about your city (you & the city), contribute to local charity projects (U4 the world), share your own amazing photos (your WOW shot), and tell us the tale of your out of the ordinary, or extreme travels (unYOUsual trips).\r\n\r\nKiss From The World, the channel which gives the magazine its name, is the place to send your photos of your kisses! Wherever you go in the world, take a snap of a kiss on that backdrop. And take part in a global puzzle of memorable moments.\r\n\r\nBut it doesn’t end there. Get in the driving seat on Launch an idea and send us your inspiring suggestions.\r\n\r\nKiss From The World is bursting with energy and ready to sweep its readers into a whirlwind of emotions - just like a journey through the extraordinary ‘normality’ of the world!",
