Someone who is living a difficult situation, maybe one that is really dramatic? \r\n\r\nEvery time you travel, you have a chance to encounter unfortunate conditions that are benefiting from local non-profit organizations working  in the background.\r\n\r\nEvery day.\r\n\r\nSo why don’t you take advantage of your trip to give a little piece of a dream to someone who needs your contribution?\r\n\r\nYour trip will become more meaningful, your horizon will be widened, the hopes of others become your own.\r\n\r\nOur names are Domenico and Giulia and we are speaking out of experience. Because we do this on a regular basis. \r\n\r\nHow is it done? Before you leave, organise a little collection of funds among your friends and relatives. If you are the kind of person who is very organised and leaves nothing to chance, look for and choose a local organization before your departure. Otherwise, you can find one wherever you choose to go. There are schools, orphanages, hospitals, medical centres and associations filled with volunteers who are fighting against hunger, war and illness every day. Meeting these volunteers is an experience that will paint any trip with the colours of humanity. And it will become a memorable trip. \r\n\r\nCome on, participate. Record your trip with videos and photographs and let us know about the associations that you helped. Getting the word out about their work through their internet sites is a small, yet great contribution.\r\nAnd remember, to quote Einstein: “ we must become champions of humanity”…\r\n",
                "description": "Kiss From The World is a unique online magazine packed with videos and photos taken all over the world, extraordinary journeys and one-of-a-kind encounters.\r\n\r\nKiss From The World makes you the traveller, taking you to the heart of the action, into the depths of forests, to interviews with hardened gang leaders, into a world of unknown tribes, war zones, exotic parties…\r\n\r\nBut it also takes you on a journey into daily life, and the extraordinary normality of the world.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nKiss From The World, the people\r\n\r\nThe idea for the magazine came to life in 2007 when Domenico Pacifico, photojournalist, started sharing online his exclusive reportage. Domenico and his partner Giulia travel the globe, documenting their journeys and the people they meet.\r\n\r\nTo travel, to film, to photograph: Domenico’s techniques as a reporter and his curiosity as a traveller to discover the cultures, ethnicities and religions of the people he meets means he can bring all of these strands together on his website. You might not notice the people in his videos and photos if you pass them on the street. Here, they become vivid and real. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nKiss From The World, the channels\r\n\r\niPeople: on Kiss From The World, places matter, but above all, people matter, as this channel shows. iPeople is rich with stirring encounters with men and women who are all special in their worlds and their daily lives.\r\n\r\nTribe tells the story of meetings in the depths of forests, far from civilization, and of different ways of living, even when surprisingly near major urban areas.\r\n\r\nDanger Zone tells stories of areas best avoided by the traveller. It speaks of dangerous neighbourhoods, countries at war, and realities where the people are rootless, and there is no law.\r\n\r\nSexy World is a journey into the “hottest” places on the globe. Take a dip in a world of parties and overwhelming sensuality.\r\n\r\nAnd then there’s Kaleidoscope – quite simply photos and music, and Post-it - images without comments.\r\n\r\nAnimals takes you on a journey into natural habitats and reserves, to discover surprising aspects of animal life, told by the people who observe them every day - either for passion or profession.\r\n\r\nAnd then there’s Travel & help, where you’ll find out about the most vulnerable people that Domenico and Giulia met and helped during their journeys, either directly or via small local organizations.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nKiss From The World, minute by minute\r\n\r\nOn Kiss From The World, take a journey with travellers and experience it as if in real-time.\r\n\r\nTravel Book is a collection of travel journals packed with thousands of photos and minute by minute annotations.\r\n\r\nWhat’s Up - snippets and tasters of what’s to come next in the magazine.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nKiss From The World: the users - reporters like us!\r\n\r\nKiss From The World readers have the chance to become part of an even bigger journey. Tell us about your city (you & the city), contribute to local charity projects (U4 the world), share your own amazing photos (your WOW shot), and tell us the tale of your out of the ordinary, or extreme travels (unYOUsual trips).\r\n\r\nKiss From The World, the channel which gives the magazine its name, is the place to send your photos of your kisses! Wherever you go in the world, take a snap of a kiss on that backdrop. And take part in a global puzzle of memorable moments.\r\n\r\nBut it doesn’t end there. Get in the driving seat on Launch an idea and send us your inspiring suggestions.\r\n\r\nKiss From The World is bursting with energy and ready to sweep its readers into a whirlwind of emotions - just like a journey through the extraordinary ‘normality’ of the world!",

McGivney, assistant pastor of St. Mary’s Church in New Haven and some of his parishioners, the Connecticut state legislature on March 29, 1882, officially chartered the Knights of Columbus as a fraternal benefit society. The Order is still true to its founding principles of charity, unity and fraternity.\r\n\r\nThe Knights was formed to render financial aid to members and their families. Mutual aid and assistance are offered to sick, disabled and needy members and their families. Social and intellectual fellowship is promoted among members and their families through educational, charitable, religious, social welfare, war relief and public relief works.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Order shows how the foresight of Father Michael J. McGivney, whose cause for sainthood is being investigated by the Vatican, brought about what has become the world's foremost Catholic fraternal benefit society. The Order has helped families obtain economic security and stability through its life insurance, annuity and long-term care programs, and has contributed time and energy worldwide to service in communities.\r\n\r\nThe Knights of Columbus has grown from several members in one council to more than 13,000 councils and 1.7 million members throughout the United States, Canada, the Philippines, Mexico, Poland, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Panama, the Bahamas, the Virgin Islands, Cuba, Guatemala, Guam and Saipan.\r\n",

Sustainable development projects include recycling, solar, re-use, organic agriculture, health, etc. \r\n\r\nWe support enterprises that care about the earth and all of its inhabitants. We have no religious, racial or political affiliations of any kind. We want to encourage sustainable enterprises that recycle, reuse, repurpose and use environmentally sound agricultural and manufacturing practices. \r\nMany of us would like Kiva to develop environmental standards or criteria for their lending practices to prevent environmental impacts that would increase poverty for future generations.\r\nMany people want to have a green portfolio, or at least a green component. \r\nWon't you join us in creating true sustainability that includes a healthy environment?",

Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

Some take it to the extreme (like using numbers in relationships - classifying/rating friends etc). Obviously, this is not the right thing to do. Depending on numbers is good, as long as it is done artfully and within reason. Problem is - we have so much data today, and such powerful tools to analyze these data that it is pure fun to play with it and very easy to lose track of the big picture/real goal.\r\n\r\nLATEST ACTIVITY\r\n\r\nPlease reinstate the positioning and the format of the \"latest activity\" (to prior to the Feb 19th changes) One was encouraged to join in and even if it was just to see the same picture appear multiple times across the team board. This often happened especially in small teams. Now latest activity is barely visible, because it was shrinked and moved to the lower part of the page. \r\n\r\nMESSAGE BOARDS\r\n\r\nWe critize an overall decline of message board functionality. If one checks in to read messages, no one wants to have to click twice – do not abbreviate messages. It is also no fun to find that one has to leave the messages area to see anything else. It is not inviting about posting messages because before being able to post a, say, question, one has to click „View All“ and there is no indication that that would get you to posting messages. Featured messages subtly alter the relationships between the Team Captains and the regular team members, and that is not a good thing especially if a website is about leveling the playing field. Mechanically, those (usually long) featured posts are getting in the way when lenders try to communicate with each other. The Flag button creates an atmosphere that makes lively discussions less likely. The profile pics appear smaller than before\r\n\r\nPERSONAL PORTFOLIO\r\n\r\n\"It can be difficult to accept the limits on our ability to help others...But when you help just one person, or let one person help you, it can be hard not to glimpse the better world so frustratingly near our grasp.\" (The International Bank of Bob pg. 311)\r\n\r\nNow the portfolio is just another bunch of numbers judging your effectivity. An acceptable solution would be to make a separate page for stats and not make it default. For those who want stats, they can go there and for those of us who just want to check those occasionally we can ignore that page easily. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe page you see when paying for loans got cluttered up.

It just takes one small step by each of us lending on kiva. Together we can make it easier for hard working people to get the much-needed capital to sustain and grow their business. We feel blessed to be able to support the aspirations of so many loan recipients who persevere tenaciously for a better quality of life with dignity. Kudos to Kiva.org that allows us to connect for this common cause.",
                "description": "In our team, we have a vision to change lives in novel ways. Our team's origin began with a Kiva Card (gift certificate) whose recipient founded this team. Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.
