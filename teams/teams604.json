Kudos to Kiva.org that allows us to connect for this common cause.",
                "description": "In our team, we have a vision to change lives in novel ways. Our team's origin began with a Kiva Card (gift certificate) whose recipient founded this team. Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

The Library promotes exploration and scholarship through its collections, exhibits, and programs. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2010, the Library will examine Mary Baker Eddy's personal story of service through a year long exhibit. Visitors will also be introduced to individuals, companies and institutions today that give of themselves. Viewers will be invited to ask themselves how they could do the same.\r\n\r\nThis Kiva Lending Team is one such invitation and will open with the exhibition on April 6.

Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

Despite hard economic times, we continue to be successful and continue to enjoy our association with wonderful coworkers, clients and associated businesses.    Additionally, in all the world, we all live in the greatest and most privileged country, we enjoy the most prosperous time in all history and we get see so much beauty every day.\r\n\r\nBecause of these great privileges, the QLS team feels that we have a responsibility to return some of what we have to the world community.   Recently, a group of us were enjoying a dinner together and were talking about the disparity between our lives and the lives of so many people thoughout the world who are so much less fortunate than we are.  As we discussed these topics and looked for ways that we could possibly help and make a difference, a great idea began to germinate.\r\n\r\nOur dinner discussion started as a desire to help those less fortunate.  It started as a challenge amongst ourselves, but we decided that it could be much bigger than that.  QLS has decided to target Kiva as a preferred charity.  Along with our employees, we will be including information on our website about Kiva and will be inviting clients and vendors to participate in our efforts to further the Kiva mission.  \r\n\r\nOur Challenge:\r\n\r\nFirst.  We have decided to pick one day a month and not eat anything for 24 hours (skipping 2 meals).  The purpose of this fast is to allow ourselves to feel and relate in a very small way to what millions around the world experience every day.  \r\n\r\nSecond.  In addition to fostering this compassionate experience, we are going to take the money we would have spent on the uneaten food and use that to fund our Kiva microloans.  ",
