                "description": "In our team, we have a vision to change lives in novel ways. Our team's origin began with a Kiva Card (gift certificate) whose recipient founded this team. Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

We're dedicated to bringing the joy and learning of baseball to young people in Cambodia. \r\n_________________________________________________\r\n\r\nHere is Joe's story in his own words: \r\n\r\n \"Hello, I'm Joe Cook, Cambodian-American, 35 years old married with two children. I have worked as a chef for over 15 years and currently work at the Mikata Japanese Steakhouse in Dothan, Alabama. I first fell in love with baseball when I came to America at 12 years old. \r\n\r\nEscaping to America\r\n\r\n\"During the 1970s, Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge began brutally enforcing radical communism. Mass executions, starvation and disease killed more than two million Cambodians - including my father and two younger sisters. \r\n\r\n\"Land mines and other wire mines also killed over 80,000 people and wounded 900,000 more. I was one of those wounded by a wire tree mine. \r\n\r\n\"Since the day I was born in 1970, I experienced suffering due to war, poverty, illness and no education. After my father was killed, my family was sent to work in labor camps - and in 1976 three of my sisters were separated and lost. In late 1978, when I was eight years old, my mother, oldest brother and me escaped from our camp and began a journey to the Thailand border. \r\n\r\n\"We walked and ran bare foot for four days and three nights. I was starved and exhausted and near death, following my accident with the tree wire mine, but we made it to the border. And, after four miraculous years in refugee camps, we came to Chattanooga, Tennessee on May 13, 1983. \r\n\r\n\"I am very lucky and proud to be in America. \r\n\r\nTraveling back to Cambodia \r\n\r\n \"Nearly twenty years after coming to America, I heard that my sister was alive and I went back to Cambodia to reunite with her and her family in May 2002. \r\n\r\n\"While I was there, my niece and nephew took me to see their school and friends. \r\n\r\n\"After seeing the school, I knew what I must do to help the children and the school. I told them that when I came back I would bring baseball and school supplies. \r\n\r\n\"No one had ever heard anything about baseball before - and had no idea what I was talking about. At the time, I had no equipment to show them so I promised that when I came back to Cambodia I would bring some. \r\n\r\n \"A few weeks later, back in Dothan, Alabama I began collecting school and baseball equipment to send to those children in Cambodia. And I am extremely grateful to the those who helped me collect these supplies. \r\n\r\nBaseball is born in Cambodia \r\n\r\n\"In November 2002, I returned to Cambodia as promised with gifts for the children and donations of school and baseball equipment for the MeasChum school in the city Baribo, 68 miles west of Phnom Penh. \r\n\r\n\"Over the following days, I helped the children build Cambodia's first baseball field. And on November 26, 2002 baseball was 'born' in Cambodia and I officially introduced it to people for the first time. \r\n\r\n\"I taught the children and teachers how to pitch, throw, catch, hit and run the bases. They soon got the idea - and I was so happy to see children playing baseball for the first in Cambodia. \r\n\r\n\"In Baribo, baseball has grown into a very popular sport. More and more children and adults have gotten involved. Some players had walked over three days to play or learn baseball. \r\n\r\n \"Within five months, the people and the Mayor of Baribo donated land to build a second ballpark called Koom Baseball Field. \r\n\r\n\"Baseball equipment is hard to come by for these players and many play with bare feet and no gear. Baseballs, themselves, are in limited supply too. And never thrown away regardless of their condition. I am always looking for extra equipment. And, now, there are more than 50 schools that would love to participate. \r\n\r\nCoaching Baseball from a world away \r\n\r\n\"Since 2002, I have been coaching baseball from across the globe - via the internet. \r\n\r\n\"Every night in Dothan (Cambodia is 12 hours ahead), I go online to communicate with those who run the programs for me in Cambodia. \r\n\r\n On my off days from the restaurant, I go to local high schools and ballparks to videotape baseball games to send to Cambodia. these tapes are a great teaching tool for the players. \r\n\r\n\"Bringing baseball to Cambodia is my passion. And I am determined to help others have a better life. \r\n\r\n\"Thanks to generous support from people like you, we are making progress. But I am hopeful we can do much more. Today, we're working to raise funds to create two new ball fields in the provinces of Kompong Chnang and Kompong Cham. And we're always collecting baseball gear\". \r\n\r\n\r\nIf you would like to learn more about how you or your organization can make a donation, please contact us at joe@cambodiabaseball.org or joecook_@hotmail.com.

                "description": "Alan's account of the founding of LLL is on the  team board @Alan re: #260143. Loans that are nearing expiry won't get funded if they don't get noticed. We look for loans that are about to expire by using the Sort By:\r\n\"Expiring Soon\" option instead of the default \"Popularity\", and then work to get them funded.\r\n\r\nSee our team FAQ, linked above (the \"Team Website\" button, next to our traffic light avatar).\r\n\r\nA Team LLL glossary (contributed by team member Tony):\r\n\r\nRed Loans: Loans that have less than five days to be funded, identifiable by the red box with the notice that says \"Only x days left!\" or \r\n\"Only x hours and y minutes left!\"\r\n\r\nLLL - Late Loaning Lenders: this team, where \r\nlenders work together to keep loans from \r\nexpiring.\r\n\r\nSFDD - Starfish Daily Dozen: Under current \r\npractice, one of these lists is prepared and \r\nposted for each day, to help LLL lenders focus \r\nand coordinate their lending on a targeted \r\ngroup of loans (the Starfish or SF). The lists \r\nare prepared by a group of volunteers who \r\nseek to be objective in selecting the loans to \r\nbe included in their lists. They also seek to \r\nspread out the loans in each list over a 24 hour \r\nperiod and to share the joy among the Field \r\nPartners with loans expiring during that period, \r\nbut their efforts are always constrained by the \r\nchoice of loans that are available for inclusion \r\nin the list. Loans with larger amounts needed \r\nwill be included in the period immediately after \r\neach Credit Day, when lenders are feeling \r\nflush, but the lists will become less ambitious \r\nwhen the LLL lenders are feeling poor.\r\n\r\nGG - Gorgeous Group: The SFDD list-makers usually add one or two of these loans at the end of the SF daily dozen lists. As the name \r\nimplies, only group loans are picked. When it is \r\nfirst posted, a typical GG loan will expire two \r\ndays or more after the list is posted. It will \r\nusually be retained as a GG until it becomes \r\nFully Funded or moves into Starfish range. The amount needed when the loan is selected as a GG will vary depending on the time of month.\r\n\r\nOPM - Abbreviation for \"other people's money.\"  Our main lending method is to coordinate LLL team members' loans, so that we make several loans to a borrower within a short period of time. This will move the borrower's loan request up in Kiva's \"popularity\" sort and get the loan noticed by other people (non-members of the LLL team).  Many loans then get their funding completed by loans from those non-LLL members.  By attracting other lenders' attention to our Starfish loans in this way, we multiply the impact of our finite funds, and save more loans from expiring than we otherwise could.\r\n\r\nRTR - Reduce the Red: These lists are \r\nprepared and posted when there are large \r\nnumbers of loans slated to expire in a short \r\nperiod of time. \"Red\" is a reference to the red \r\nboxes that are added to a loan description \r\nwhen the Loan is about to expire without full \r\nfunding.\r\n\r\nBulge: A short period in which a great many loans have their scheduled funding expiration times. This may happen when, for example, the volunteer coordinators at Kiva offer a promo of some kind to the editors & translators, to get them to do a lot of work in a very short period of time. Bulge loans are prime candidates for inclusion in Reduce the Red lists.\r\n\r\nBTB - Battling the Boxes: On those days where \r\nthere aren't 12 loans that qualify as \"Starfish,\" the listmakers will include loans that have their red boxes, but more than 24 hours left before their deadline, to make up the 12 loans for the list. The criteria are similar to SF \r\nloans, i.e., one per field partner and reasonable \r\namounts left to fund (not too much; not too \r\nlittle), except that these loans may have a longer time left before their expiry date. If they gain good traction on their first BTB day, they may be carried forward. If not ... they stand a second chance as SF.\r\n\r\nFF - Fully Funded: This is LLL code for a loan \r\nthat has received all the loans required for it to be removed from the list of loans that are raising funds \r\nand to move into paying back status.\r\n\r\nLars Ratio: the average funding per hour that is needed for a loan to become fully funded.\r\n(Developed by team member Lars)\r\n\r\nWiedergänger (contributed by Maria) - German expression, literal translation \"again walker,\" meaning \"undead,\" i.e. a person that has died but comes back, aka a zombie. Here it means a loan that disappears from the page, but comes back again because somebody didn't check out their basket.\r\n\r\nRuma sana (contributed by Jouko and Potkukelkka) - Finnish expression, literal translation \"ugly words.\"  It is a phrase to use when you are very frustrated, but want to stop just short of actual cursing -- for example, when the Kiva site repeatedly logs you out when you are trying to rescue an expiring loan at the last second.\r\n\r\nSee data about all loans currently fundraising on Kiva:\r\nwww.kivatools.com\r\nSee data about loans that have been mentioned on the LLL board, including the most recent lending activity on each loan:\r\nhttp://starfish.dynalias.org/\r\nSee loans in real time, as they are made:\r\nhttp://www.http://kivalive.com/index2.php\r\n\r\nLists are posted on the LLL Team message \r\nboard.

We want to encourage sustainable enterprises that recycle, reuse, repurpose and use environmentally sound agricultural and manufacturing practices. \r\nMany of us would like Kiva to develop environmental standards or criteria for their lending practices to prevent environmental impacts that would increase poverty for future generations.\r\nMany people want to have a green portfolio, or at least a green component. \r\nWon't you join us in creating true sustainability that includes a healthy environment?",

                "description": "Alan's account of the founding of LLL is on the  team board @Alan re: #260143. Loans that are nearing expiry won't get funded if they don't get noticed. We look for loans that are about to expire by using the Sort By:\r\n\"Expiring Soon\" option instead of the default \"Popularity\", and then work to get them funded.\r\n\r\nSee our team FAQ, linked above (the \"Team Website\" button, next to our traffic light avatar).\r\n\r\nA Team LLL glossary (contributed by team member Tony):\r\n\r\nRed Loans: Loans that have less than five days to be funded, identifiable by the red box with the notice that says \"Only x days left!\" or \r\n\"Only x hours and y minutes left!\"\r\n\r\nLLL - Late Loaning Lenders: this team, where \r\nlenders work together to keep loans from \r\nexpiring.\r\n\r\nSFDD - Starfish Daily Dozen: Under current \r\npractice, one of these lists is prepared and \r\nposted for each day, to help LLL lenders focus \r\nand coordinate their lending on a targeted \r\ngroup of loans (the Starfish or SF). The lists \r\nare prepared by a group of volunteers who \r\nseek to be objective in selecting the loans to \r\nbe included in their lists. They also seek to \r\nspread out the loans in each list over a 24 hour \r\nperiod and to share the joy among the Field \r\nPartners with loans expiring during that period, \r\nbut their efforts are always constrained by the \r\nchoice of loans that are available for inclusion \r\nin the list. Loans with larger amounts needed \r\nwill be included in the period immediately after \r\neach Credit Day, when lenders are feeling \r\nflush, but the lists will become less ambitious \r\nwhen the LLL lenders are feeling poor.\r\n\r\nGG - Gorgeous Group: The SFDD list-makers usually add one or two of these loans at the end of the SF daily dozen lists. As the name \r\nimplies, only group loans are picked. When it is \r\nfirst posted, a typical GG loan will expire two \r\ndays or more after the list is posted. It will \r\nusually be retained as a GG until it becomes \r\nFully Funded or moves into Starfish range. The amount needed when the loan is selected as a GG will vary depending on the time of month.\r\n\r\nOPM - Abbreviation for \"other people's money.\"  Our main lending method is to coordinate LLL team members' loans, so that we make several loans to a borrower within a short period of time. This will move the borrower's loan request up in Kiva's \"popularity\" sort and get the loan noticed by other people (non-members of the LLL team).  Many loans then get their funding completed by loans from those non-LLL members.  By attracting other lenders' attention to our Starfish loans in this way, we multiply the impact of our finite funds, and save more loans from expiring than we otherwise could.\r\n\r\nRTR - Reduce the Red: These lists are \r\nprepared and posted when there are large \r\nnumbers of loans slated to expire in a short \r\nperiod of time. \"Red\" is a reference to the red \r\nboxes that are added to a loan description \r\nwhen the Loan is about to expire without full \r\nfunding.\r\n\r\nBulge: A short period in which a great many loans have their scheduled funding expiration times. This may happen when, for example, the volunteer coordinators at Kiva offer a promo of some kind to the editors & translators, to get them to do a lot of work in a very short period of time. Bulge loans are prime candidates for inclusion in Reduce the Red lists.\r\n\r\nBTB - Battling the Boxes: On those days where \r\nthere aren't 12 loans that qualify as \"Starfish,\" the listmakers will include loans that have their red boxes, but more than 24 hours left before their deadline, to make up the 12 loans for the list. The criteria are similar to SF \r\nloans, i.e., one per field partner and reasonable \r\namounts left to fund (not too much; not too \r\nlittle), except that these loans may have a longer time left before their expiry date. If they gain good traction on their first BTB day, they may be carried forward. If not ... they stand a second chance as SF.\r\n\r\nFF - Fully Funded: This is LLL code for a loan \r\nthat has received all the loans required for it to be removed from the list of loans that are raising funds \r\nand to move into paying back status.\r\n\r\nLars Ratio: the average funding per hour that is needed for a loan to become fully funded.\r\n(Developed by team member Lars)\r\n\r\nWiedergänger (contributed by Maria) - German expression, literal translation \"again walker,\" meaning \"undead,\" i.e. a person that has died but comes back, aka a zombie. Here it means a loan that disappears from the page, but comes back again because somebody didn't check out their basket.\r\n\r\nRuma sana (contributed by Jouko and Potkukelkka) - Finnish expression, literal translation \"ugly words.\"  It is a phrase to use when you are very frustrated, but want to stop just short of actual cursing -- for example, when the Kiva site repeatedly logs you out when you are trying to rescue an expiring loan at the last second.\r\n\r\nSee data about all loans currently fundraising on Kiva:\r\nwww.kivatools.com\r\nSee data about loans that have been mentioned on the LLL board, including the most recent lending activity on each loan:\r\nhttp://starfish.dynalias.org/\r\nSee loans in real time, as they are made:\r\nhttp://www.http://kivalive.com/index2.php\r\n\r\nLists are posted on the LLL Team message \r\nboard.

Abdusattor drove a car for a living, but he wanted a loan to begin selling watermelons. Meanwhile, Mirmahmud sold watermelons, but he wanted a loan to purchase a car. When these loans posted on the same day, we knew that we had to get them together!  Cars and watermelons? They go together in ways we never would have imagined!\r\n\r\nIn the developing world, entrepreneurs sometimes wind up in unlikely professions or combining businesses  that we might not ordinarily expect to go together.  Through such immprobable business combinations, these entrepreneuers have found ways to be successful by filling the unique needs of their communities. \r\n\r\nThis team  celebrates all of the wonderful and unlikely enterprises and pairings of enterprises that Kiva borrowers are involved in. Of course, we have a special soft spot for \"watermelon+car\" loans.  Also, we like alliteration.\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nMore details about our first two borrowers can be found here.\r\nAbdusattor: www.kiva.org/lend/456025\r\nMirmahmud: www.kiva.org/lend/455461\r\n\r\nImages of wheeled watermelons adapted from http://foodstylin.com/gallery.asp?gal=6&tp=img&id=66 & http://www.offbeatearth.com/watermelon-car/",
