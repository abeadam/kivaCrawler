Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

                "description": "The Kiva website was easy to use and got people connected. Kiva was fun.\r\n\r\nEngineers tend to think in numbers - they rely on numbers for anything and everything. Some take it to the extreme (like using numbers in relationships - classifying/rating friends etc). Obviously, this is not the right thing to do. Depending on numbers is good, as long as it is done artfully and within reason. Problem is - we have so much data today, and such powerful tools to analyze these data that it is pure fun to play with it and very easy to lose track of the big picture/real goal.\r\n\r\nLATEST ACTIVITY\r\n\r\nPlease reinstate the positioning and the format of the \"latest activity\" (to prior to the Feb 19th changes) One was encouraged to join in and even if it was just to see the same picture appear multiple times across the team board. This often happened especially in small teams. Now latest activity is barely visible, because it was shrinked and moved to the lower part of the page. \r\n\r\nMESSAGE BOARDS\r\n\r\nWe critize an overall decline of message board functionality. If one checks in to read messages, no one wants to have to click twice – do not abbreviate messages. It is also no fun to find that one has to leave the messages area to see anything else. It is not inviting about posting messages because before being able to post a, say, question, one has to click „View All“ and there is no indication that that would get you to posting messages. Featured messages subtly alter the relationships between the Team Captains and the regular team members, and that is not a good thing especially if a website is about leveling the playing field. Mechanically, those (usually long) featured posts are getting in the way when lenders try to communicate with each other. The Flag button creates an atmosphere that makes lively discussions less likely. The profile pics appear smaller than before\r\n\r\nPERSONAL PORTFOLIO\r\n\r\n\"It can be difficult to accept the limits on our ability to help others...But when you help just one person, or let one person help you, it can be hard not to glimpse the better world so frustratingly near our grasp.\" (The International Bank of Bob pg. 311)\r\n\r\nNow the portfolio is just another bunch of numbers judging your effectivity. An acceptable solution would be to make a separate page for stats and not make it default. For those who want stats, they can go there and for those of us who just want to check those occasionally we can ignore that page easily. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe page you see when paying for loans got cluttered up.

As a key tenet in carrying out this mission, UC Merced promotes and celebrates the diversity of all members of its community.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-first century has opened with the promise of new ways of connecting people to new knowledge and to one another. UC Merced opens as a network, not simply a single place, linking its students, faculty and staff to the educational resources of the state, nation and world. The idea of network extends to UC Merced’s relationships with neighboring institutions: educational, cultural and social. UC Merced seeks strong and mutually supportive relationships with a variety of collaborators in its region: public and private colleges and universities; federal and state organizations that share UC Merced’s educational and research goals; and cultural and social institutions.\r\n\r\nGo Bobcats!",

                "description": "Alan's account of the founding of LLL is on the  team board @Alan re: #260143. Loans that are nearing expiry won't get funded if they don't get noticed. We look for loans that are about to expire by using the Sort By:\r\n\"Expiring Soon\" option instead of the default \"Popularity\", and then work to get them funded.\r\n\r\nSee our team FAQ, linked above (the \"Team Website\" button, next to our traffic light avatar).\r\n\r\nA Team LLL glossary (contributed by team member Tony):\r\n\r\nRed Loans: Loans that have less than five days to be funded, identifiable by the red box with the notice that says \"Only x days left!\" or \r\n\"Only x hours and y minutes left!\"\r\n\r\nLLL - Late Loaning Lenders: this team, where \r\nlenders work together to keep loans from \r\nexpiring.\r\n\r\nSFDD - Starfish Daily Dozen: Under current \r\npractice, one of these lists is prepared and \r\nposted for each day, to help LLL lenders focus \r\nand coordinate their lending on a targeted \r\ngroup of loans (the Starfish or SF). The lists \r\nare prepared by a group of volunteers who \r\nseek to be objective in selecting the loans to \r\nbe included in their lists. They also seek to \r\nspread out the loans in each list over a 24 hour \r\nperiod and to share the joy among the Field \r\nPartners with loans expiring during that period, \r\nbut their efforts are always constrained by the \r\nchoice of loans that are available for inclusion \r\nin the list. Loans with larger amounts needed \r\nwill be included in the period immediately after \r\neach Credit Day, when lenders are feeling \r\nflush, but the lists will become less ambitious \r\nwhen the LLL lenders are feeling poor.\r\n\r\nGG - Gorgeous Group: The SFDD list-makers usually add one or two of these loans at the end of the SF daily dozen lists. As the name \r\nimplies, only group loans are picked. When it is \r\nfirst posted, a typical GG loan will expire two \r\ndays or more after the list is posted. It will \r\nusually be retained as a GG until it becomes \r\nFully Funded or moves into Starfish range. The amount needed when the loan is selected as a GG will vary depending on the time of month.\r\n\r\nOPM - Abbreviation for \"other people's money.\"  Our main lending method is to coordinate LLL team members' loans, so that we make several loans to a borrower within a short period of time. This will move the borrower's loan request up in Kiva's \"popularity\" sort and get the loan noticed by other people (non-members of the LLL team).  Many loans then get their funding completed by loans from those non-LLL members.  By attracting other lenders' attention to our Starfish loans in this way, we multiply the impact of our finite funds, and save more loans from expiring than we otherwise could.\r\n\r\nRTR - Reduce the Red: These lists are \r\nprepared and posted when there are large \r\nnumbers of loans slated to expire in a short \r\nperiod of time. \"Red\" is a reference to the red \r\nboxes that are added to a loan description \r\nwhen the Loan is about to expire without full \r\nfunding.\r\n\r\nBulge: A short period in which a great many loans have their scheduled funding expiration times. This may happen when, for example, the volunteer coordinators at Kiva offer a promo of some kind to the editors & translators, to get them to do a lot of work in a very short period of time. Bulge loans are prime candidates for inclusion in Reduce the Red lists.\r\n\r\nBTB - Battling the Boxes: On those days where \r\nthere aren't 12 loans that qualify as \"Starfish,\" the listmakers will include loans that have their red boxes, but more than 24 hours left before their deadline, to make up the 12 loans for the list. The criteria are similar to SF \r\nloans, i.e., one per field partner and reasonable \r\namounts left to fund (not too much; not too \r\nlittle), except that these loans may have a longer time left before their expiry date. If they gain good traction on their first BTB day, they may be carried forward. If not ... they stand a second chance as SF.\r\n\r\nFF - Fully Funded: This is LLL code for a loan \r\nthat has received all the loans required for it to be removed from the list of loans that are raising funds \r\nand to move into paying back status.\r\n\r\nLars Ratio: the average funding per hour that is needed for a loan to become fully funded.\r\n(Developed by team member Lars)\r\n\r\nWiedergänger (contributed by Maria) - German expression, literal translation \"again walker,\" meaning \"undead,\" i.e. a person that has died but comes back, aka a zombie. Here it means a loan that disappears from the page, but comes back again because somebody didn't check out their basket.\r\n\r\nRuma sana (contributed by Jouko and Potkukelkka) - Finnish expression, literal translation \"ugly words.\"  It is a phrase to use when you are very frustrated, but want to stop just short of actual cursing -- for example, when the Kiva site repeatedly logs you out when you are trying to rescue an expiring loan at the last second.\r\n\r\nSee data about all loans currently fundraising on Kiva:\r\nwww.kivatools.com\r\nSee data about loans that have been mentioned on the LLL board, including the most recent lending activity on each loan:\r\nhttp://starfish.dynalias.org/\r\nSee loans in real time, as they are made:\r\nhttp://www.http://kivalive.com/index2.php\r\n\r\nLists are posted on the LLL Team message \r\nboard.

This is a forum to notify each other of environmentally sustainable loans that are needing funding. Sustainable development projects include recycling, solar, re-use, organic agriculture, health, etc. \r\n\r\nWe support enterprises that care about the earth and all of its inhabitants. We have no religious, racial or political affiliations of any kind. We want to encourage sustainable enterprises that recycle, reuse, repurpose and use environmentally sound agricultural and manufacturing practices. \r\nMany of us would like Kiva to develop environmental standards or criteria for their lending practices to prevent environmental impacts that would increase poverty for future generations.\r\nMany people want to have a green portfolio, or at least a green component. \r\nWon't you join us in creating true sustainability that includes a healthy environment?",
