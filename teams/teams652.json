For each race I run, I will ask my friends and family to \"sponsor\" me by lending to Kiva. While the goal is to lend at least $400 per race, around the cost of an average Kiva loan, my hope is that the impact will be even greater as the word gets out.

Although most of these loans are \r\npre-funded by the Field Partners, the Field\r\nPartners lose out on the capital if a loan\r\ndoesn't get funded on Kiva. We believe that \r\nthis will damage the Field Partners in the long \r\nterm and impair their capacity to make loans to new borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe can't save every red loan, but we try to\r\nmake a difference as in the Starfish Story:\r\nhttp://67.199.70.191/articles/the-starfish-story.aspx\r\nHelp us fund loans we're already supporting:\r\nhttp://www.kiva.org/team/late_loaning_lenders/loans?status=fundRaising\r\n\r\n\r\nCheck out Charlotte's Web: http://starfish.dynalias.org\r\n\r\nThis watchlist for loans suggested by the team members (starfish + offlist) shows:\r\n* the current position in the popularity ranking (considering pages 1 to 5)\r\n* the timestamp of the most recent loan\r\n* the basket amount\r\nClick magnifier icon for more info.

                "description": "Alan's account of the founding of LLL is on the  team board @Alan re: #260143. Loans that are nearing expiry won't get funded if they don't get noticed. We look for loans that are about to expire by using the Sort By:\r\n\"Expiring Soon\" option instead of the default \"Popularity\", and then work to get them funded.\r\n\r\nSee our team FAQ, linked above (the \"Team Website\" button, next to our traffic light avatar).\r\n\r\nA Team LLL glossary (contributed by team member Tony):\r\n\r\nRed Loans: Loans that have less than five days to be funded, identifiable by the red box with the notice that says \"Only x days left!\" or \r\n\"Only x hours and y minutes left!\"\r\n\r\nLLL - Late Loaning Lenders: this team, where \r\nlenders work together to keep loans from \r\nexpiring.\r\n\r\nSFDD - Starfish Daily Dozen: Under current \r\npractice, one of these lists is prepared and \r\nposted for each day, to help LLL lenders focus \r\nand coordinate their lending on a targeted \r\ngroup of loans (the Starfish or SF). The lists \r\nare prepared by a group of volunteers who \r\nseek to be objective in selecting the loans to \r\nbe included in their lists. They also seek to \r\nspread out the loans in each list over a 24 hour \r\nperiod and to share the joy among the Field \r\nPartners with loans expiring during that period, \r\nbut their efforts are always constrained by the \r\nchoice of loans that are available for inclusion \r\nin the list. Loans with larger amounts needed \r\nwill be included in the period immediately after \r\neach Credit Day, when lenders are feeling \r\nflush, but the lists will become less ambitious \r\nwhen the LLL lenders are feeling poor.\r\n\r\nGG - Gorgeous Group: The SFDD list-makers usually add one or two of these loans at the end of the SF daily dozen lists. As the name \r\nimplies, only group loans are picked. When it is \r\nfirst posted, a typical GG loan will expire two \r\ndays or more after the list is posted. It will \r\nusually be retained as a GG until it becomes \r\nFully Funded or moves into Starfish range. The amount needed when the loan is selected as a GG will vary depending on the time of month.\r\n\r\nOPM - Abbreviation for \"other people's money.\"  Our main lending method is to coordinate LLL team members' loans, so that we make several loans to a borrower within a short period of time. This will move the borrower's loan request up in Kiva's \"popularity\" sort and get the loan noticed by other people (non-members of the LLL team).  Many loans then get their funding completed by loans from those non-LLL members.  By attracting other lenders' attention to our Starfish loans in this way, we multiply the impact of our finite funds, and save more loans from expiring than we otherwise could.\r\n\r\nRTR - Reduce the Red: These lists are \r\nprepared and posted when there are large \r\nnumbers of loans slated to expire in a short \r\nperiod of time. \"Red\" is a reference to the red \r\nboxes that are added to a loan description \r\nwhen the Loan is about to expire without full \r\nfunding.\r\n\r\nBulge: A short period in which a great many loans have their scheduled funding expiration times. This may happen when, for example, the volunteer coordinators at Kiva offer a promo of some kind to the editors & translators, to get them to do a lot of work in a very short period of time. Bulge loans are prime candidates for inclusion in Reduce the Red lists.\r\n\r\nBTB - Battling the Boxes: On those days where \r\nthere aren't 12 loans that qualify as \"Starfish,\" the listmakers will include loans that have their red boxes, but more than 24 hours left before their deadline, to make up the 12 loans for the list. The criteria are similar to SF \r\nloans, i.e., one per field partner and reasonable \r\namounts left to fund (not too much; not too \r\nlittle), except that these loans may have a longer time left before their expiry date. If they gain good traction on their first BTB day, they may be carried forward. If not ... they stand a second chance as SF.\r\n\r\nFF - Fully Funded: This is LLL code for a loan \r\nthat has received all the loans required for it to be removed from the list of loans that are raising funds \r\nand to move into paying back status.\r\n\r\nLars Ratio: the average funding per hour that is needed for a loan to become fully funded.\r\n(Developed by team member Lars)\r\n\r\nWiedergänger (contributed by Maria) - German expression, literal translation \"again walker,\" meaning \"undead,\" i.e. a person that has died but comes back, aka a zombie. Here it means a loan that disappears from the page, but comes back again because somebody didn't check out their basket.\r\n\r\nRuma sana (contributed by Jouko and Potkukelkka) - Finnish expression, literal translation \"ugly words.\"  It is a phrase to use when you are very frustrated, but want to stop just short of actual cursing -- for example, when the Kiva site repeatedly logs you out when you are trying to rescue an expiring loan at the last second.\r\n\r\nSee data about all loans currently fundraising on Kiva:\r\nwww.kivatools.com\r\nSee data about loans that have been mentioned on the LLL board, including the most recent lending activity on each loan:\r\nhttp://starfish.dynalias.org/\r\nSee loans in real time, as they are made:\r\nhttp://www.http://kivalive.com/index2.php\r\n\r\nLists are posted on the LLL Team message \r\nboard.

Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

Similar loans by other lenders are combined until the required total is reached. This enables people without access to traditional banks (including many women) to expand their businesses, support and educate their children, save for the future and raise themselves out of poverty. As your money is repaid (often in monthly instalments), you can withdraw it or lend it to someone else. Money that is loaned over and over again does more good than a one-time donation!\r\n\r\nAnyone *who makes a loan* through Kiva can be a member of this team. You can invite your family and friends to join even if they are not involved in genealogy.\r\n\r\n** Please read http://genfamilies.blogspot.com/search/label/FAQ (which has important information and answers to frequently asked questions).",

                "description": "Alan's account of the founding of LLL is on the  team board @Alan re: #260143. Loans that are nearing expiry won't get funded if they don't get noticed. We look for loans that are about to expire by using the Sort By:\r\n\"Expiring Soon\" option instead of the default \"Popularity\", and then work to get them funded.\r\n\r\nSee our team FAQ, linked above (the \"Team Website\" button, next to our traffic light avatar).\r\n\r\nA Team LLL glossary (contributed by team member Tony):\r\n\r\nRed Loans: Loans that have less than five days to be funded, identifiable by the red box with the notice that says \"Only x days left!\" or \r\n\"Only x hours and y minutes left!\"\r\n\r\nLLL - Late Loaning Lenders: this team, where \r\nlenders work together to keep loans from \r\nexpiring.\r\n\r\nSFDD - Starfish Daily Dozen: Under current \r\npractice, one of these lists is prepared and \r\nposted for each day, to help LLL lenders focus \r\nand coordinate their lending on a targeted \r\ngroup of loans (the Starfish or SF). The lists \r\nare prepared by a group of volunteers who \r\nseek to be objective in selecting the loans to \r\nbe included in their lists. They also seek to \r\nspread out the loans in each list over a 24 hour \r\nperiod and to share the joy among the Field \r\nPartners with loans expiring during that period, \r\nbut their efforts are always constrained by the \r\nchoice of loans that are available for inclusion \r\nin the list. Loans with larger amounts needed \r\nwill be included in the period immediately after \r\neach Credit Day, when lenders are feeling \r\nflush, but the lists will become less ambitious \r\nwhen the LLL lenders are feeling poor.\r\n\r\nGG - Gorgeous Group: The SFDD list-makers usually add one or two of these loans at the end of the SF daily dozen lists. As the name \r\nimplies, only group loans are picked. When it is \r\nfirst posted, a typical GG loan will expire two \r\ndays or more after the list is posted. It will \r\nusually be retained as a GG until it becomes \r\nFully Funded or moves into Starfish range. The amount needed when the loan is selected as a GG will vary depending on the time of month.\r\n\r\nOPM - Abbreviation for \"other people's money.\"  Our main lending method is to coordinate LLL team members' loans, so that we make several loans to a borrower within a short period of time. This will move the borrower's loan request up in Kiva's \"popularity\" sort and get the loan noticed by other people (non-members of the LLL team).  Many loans then get their funding completed by loans from those non-LLL members.  By attracting other lenders' attention to our Starfish loans in this way, we multiply the impact of our finite funds, and save more loans from expiring than we otherwise could.\r\n\r\nRTR - Reduce the Red: These lists are \r\nprepared and posted when there are large \r\nnumbers of loans slated to expire in a short \r\nperiod of time. \"Red\" is a reference to the red \r\nboxes that are added to a loan description \r\nwhen the Loan is about to expire without full \r\nfunding.\r\n\r\nBulge: A short period in which a great many loans have their scheduled funding expiration times. This may happen when, for example, the volunteer coordinators at Kiva offer a promo of some kind to the editors & translators, to get them to do a lot of work in a very short period of time. Bulge loans are prime candidates for inclusion in Reduce the Red lists.\r\n\r\nBTB - Battling the Boxes: On those days where \r\nthere aren't 12 loans that qualify as \"Starfish,\" the listmakers will include loans that have their red boxes, but more than 24 hours left before their deadline, to make up the 12 loans for the list. The criteria are similar to SF \r\nloans, i.e., one per field partner and reasonable \r\namounts left to fund (not too much; not too \r\nlittle), except that these loans may have a longer time left before their expiry date. If they gain good traction on their first BTB day, they may be carried forward. If not ... they stand a second chance as SF.\r\n\r\nFF - Fully Funded: This is LLL code for a loan \r\nthat has received all the loans required for it to be removed from the list of loans that are raising funds \r\nand to move into paying back status.\r\n\r\nLars Ratio: the average funding per hour that is needed for a loan to become fully funded.\r\n(Developed by team member Lars)\r\n\r\nWiedergänger (contributed by Maria) - German expression, literal translation \"again walker,\" meaning \"undead,\" i.e. a person that has died but comes back, aka a zombie. Here it means a loan that disappears from the page, but comes back again because somebody didn't check out their basket.\r\n\r\nRuma sana (contributed by Jouko and Potkukelkka) - Finnish expression, literal translation \"ugly words.\"  It is a phrase to use when you are very frustrated, but want to stop just short of actual cursing -- for example, when the Kiva site repeatedly logs you out when you are trying to rescue an expiring loan at the last second.\r\n\r\nSee data about all loans currently fundraising on Kiva:\r\nwww.kivatools.com\r\nSee data about loans that have been mentioned on the LLL board, including the most recent lending activity on each loan:\r\nhttp://starfish.dynalias.org/\r\nSee loans in real time, as they are made:\r\nhttp://www.http://kivalive.com/index2.php\r\n\r\nLists are posted on the LLL Team message \r\nboard.

Reproduction is used, consciously or not, as a means to control women, to limit their options and to make them subordinate to men. In many societies a serious approach to reproductive health has to have this perspective in mind. We must seek to liberate women.\" -  Dr. Nafis Sadik Executive Director, UN Population Fund - \r\n\r\n**** THE IMPORTANCE OF GOOD HEALTH & EDUCATION TO A WOMAN'S WELL-BEING - AND THAT OF HER FAMILY & SOCIETY - CANNOT BE OVERSTATED. \r\n\r\n - - Without reproductive health and freedom, women cannot fully exercise their fundamental human rights, such as those relating to education and employment. Yet around the world, the right to health, and especially reproductive and sexual health, is far from a reality for many women. According to the World Bank, a full one-third of the illness among women ages 15-44 in developing countries is related to pregnancy, childbirth, abortion, reproductive tract infections, and human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS).  Women's disproportionate poverty, low social status, and reproductive role expose them to high health risks, resulting in needless and largely preventable suffering and deaths. Many of the women and girls who die each year during pregnancy and childbirth could have been saved by relatively low-cost improvements in reproductive healthcare; yet high levels of maternal mortality persist. The benefits of eliminating the harmful and painful practice of female genital mutilation are easily demonstrated, yet it persists for cultural and traditional reasons. And a large proportion of abortions, some resulting in death and injury, would be avoided if women and men had access to safe, affordable and effective means of contraception. - -       \r\nhttp://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/women/womrepro.htm - - - - - - - - \r\n\r\n**** EVERY MINUTE, A WOMAN DIES IN PREGNANCY OR CHILDBIRTH - -  this adds up to more than 10 million over a generation. - - Almost all of these women - 99 per cent - live and die in developing countries. A high maternal death rate is an indicator of an inadequate health care system, including those that offer poor and only limited access to health services. It also indicates that a woman’s fundamental rights to life and health are being violated. - - - Yet the vast majority of maternal deaths could be prevented. In industrialized countries, deaths owing to pregnancy and childbirth are rare. The maternal death rate in East Asia and Latin America has also decreased - by as much as 50 per cent in some countries. But in Africa and South Asia, complications during pregnancy and childbirth remain the most frequent cause of death for women. - - In some countries the number is increasing. And when women suffer and die, children suffer and die also. - - We know what it takes to save women’s lives: universal access to contraception to avoid unintended pregnancies, access to skilled care during delivery, and rapid access to quality emergency obstetric care when required. - - - - - \r\n\r\n**** THE CURRENT SITUATION  •  Every year, 536,000 women die from pregnancy related causes. This adds up to more than 10 million women over a generation. Every year, more than 1 million children are left motherless and vulnerable because of maternal death.  Children who have lost their mothers are up to 10 times more likely to die prematurely than those who haven’t. The risk of a woman dying as a result of pregnancy or childbirth during her lifetime is about 1 in 7 in Niger and about 1 in 48,000 in Ireland. 10-15 million women a year suffer severe or long-lasting illnesses or disabilities caused by complications during pregnancy or childbirth. These range from obstetric fistula to infertility and depression. The main reasons for maternal deaths are haemorrhage, infections, unsafe abortions, high blood pressure leading to seizures and obstructed labor. - - - - \r\n\r\n**** CONTRACEPTION & UNSAFE ABORTIONS - - - -  200 million women want to delay or avoid pregnancy but are not using effective contraceptives. One in three deaths related to pregnancy and childbirth could be avoided if women who wanted effective contraception had access to it. An estimated 19 million unsafe abortions take place each year in developing countries. Every year, an estimated 68,000 women die as the result of unsafe abortions and millions more suffer complications. About 90% of abortion-related deaths and disabilities worldwide could be avoided if women who wished to had access to effective contraception. - - -  \r\n\r\n*** SKILLED ASSISTANCE & EMERGENCY OBSTETRIC CARE • The number of maternal deaths is highest in countries where women are least likely to have skilled attendance at delivery. • Worldwide, 62 per cent of births are attended by a skilled health worker. Almost all births in developed countries are attended. In less developed countries, the figure is 57 per cent. In least developed countries it falls to only 34 per cent. • An estimated 35 per cent of pregnant women in developing countries do not have contact with health personnel prior to giving birth. • In sub-Saharan Africa, where most maternal deaths occur, about 70 per cent have no contact with health personnel following childbirth. • Mortality is highest during labour and the two days following a birth. • Women who undergo infibulation—a radical form of female genital mutilation that involves stitching of the external genitalia—are at higher risk of complications during and following childbirth - -  http://www.unfpa.org/safemotherhood/mediakit/documents/fs/factsheet1_eng.pdf",

Are you ready to teach your kids how to have money work hard for them and not be dependent on a pension, the government or someone else to take care of them later in life?\r\n\r\nGive your children the financial head start necessary to thrive in today's fast paced and changing world.\r\n\r\n\"I will recommend this program to every kid I can. It is the up and coming kids who are our future leaders and entrepreneurs.\"\r\n- Bill Bartmann, National Entrepreneur of the Year, http://www.BillBartmann.com\r\n\r\n\"This is the perfect resource for any kid who wants to ignite their entrepreneurial spirit.\"\r\n- Lu An Mitchell, Canada's #1 Female Entrepreneur, Motivational Speaker & Philanthropist, \r\nhttp://www.LuAnMitchell.com\r\n\r\n“It’s about time we had a curriculum to teach children real-life skills so every  child can grow up feeling confident and secure about finances.

Médecins Sans Frontières is an international medical humanitarian organization created by doctors and journalists in France in 1971.\r\n\r\nAccording to their website, MSF provides aid in nearly 60 countries to people whose survival is threatened by violence, neglect, or catastrophe, primarily due to armed conflict, epidemics, malnutrition, exclusion from health care, or natural disasters.\r\n\r\nMSF operates independently of any political, military, or religious agenda.  In 1999, MSF won the Nobel Peace Prize.\r\n\r\nThe Kiva team is not officially linked to MSF.

Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals.

McGivney, assistant pastor of St. Mary’s Church in New Haven and some of his parishioners, the Connecticut state legislature on March 29, 1882, officially chartered the Knights of Columbus as a fraternal benefit society. The Order is still true to its founding principles of charity, unity and fraternity.\r\n\r\nThe Knights was formed to render financial aid to members and their families. Mutual aid and assistance are offered to sick, disabled and needy members and their families. Social and intellectual fellowship is promoted among members and their families through educational, charitable, religious, social welfare, war relief and public relief works.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Order shows how the foresight of Father Michael J. McGivney, whose cause for sainthood is being investigated by the Vatican, brought about what has become the world's foremost Catholic fraternal benefit society. The Order has helped families obtain economic security and stability through its life insurance, annuity and long-term care programs, and has contributed time and energy worldwide to service in communities.\r\n\r\nThe Knights of Columbus has grown from several members in one council to more than 13,000 councils and 1.7 million members throughout the United States, Canada, the Philippines, Mexico, Poland, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Panama, the Bahamas, the Virgin Islands, Cuba, Guatemala, Guam and Saipan.\r\n",
