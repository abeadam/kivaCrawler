Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

Are you ready to teach your kids how to have money work hard for them and not be dependent on a pension, the government or someone else to take care of them later in life?\r\n\r\nGive your children the financial head start necessary to thrive in today's fast paced and changing world.\r\n\r\n\"I will recommend this program to every kid I can. It is the up and coming kids who are our future leaders and entrepreneurs.\"\r\n- Bill Bartmann, National Entrepreneur of the Year, http://www.BillBartmann.com\r\n\r\n\"This is the perfect resource for any kid who wants to ignite their entrepreneurial spirit.\"\r\n- Lu An Mitchell, Canada's #1 Female Entrepreneur, Motivational Speaker & Philanthropist, \r\nhttp://www.LuAnMitchell.com\r\n\r\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about time we had a curriculum to teach children real-life skills so every  child can grow up feeling confident and secure about finances.

We have no religious, racial or political affiliations of any kind. We want to encourage sustainable enterprises that recycle, reuse, repurpose and use environmentally sound agricultural and manufacturing practices. \r\nMany of us would like Kiva to develop environmental standards or criteria for their lending practices to prevent environmental impacts that would increase poverty for future generations.\r\nMany people want to have a green portfolio, or at least a green component. \r\nWon't you join us in creating true sustainability that includes a healthy environment?",
