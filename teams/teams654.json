In fact, our founder, Dudley Riggs, is one of the people credited with the invention of modern comedic improvisation. And he started performing it before Hawaii and Alaska could even be bothered to become states.\r\n\r\nToday, the Brave New Workshop Creative Outreach, led by John Sweeney, uses the positive aspects of the improvisation to transform businesses around the world. We tap into the same talent pool that have practiced, honed and perfected their skills on the Brave New Workshop stage and use them (like the actor slaves they are) to perform a variety of services including business training, humorous keynote speeches and scripted comedy. All because we truly believe that the principles of improvisation are, at their core, one of the greatest gifts we can pass along to help others improve their lives.",
