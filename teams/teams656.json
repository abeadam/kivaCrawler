As a result of a long and obstructed labour, she has a fistula and is left incontinent, an outcast from her community: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6K7BLR6MQ0E\r\n\r\n\"From Despair to Dignity\" is a short but powerful 5 minute video: http://www.yaninamanolova.com/fistula/index.html\r\n\r\nSome of our team members have visited the Fistula Hospital in Addis Ababa in Sept 2010.

The best news is that your money will hopefully be repaid to you and, with your dividend, you can support a new KIVA effort.  I've started with the first loan.  You can follow suit.  So many of you have thanked me for my poems when I did Advent or Lenten stretches.  Let's turn our thanks into a tangible form of giving and grace. 30 poems in 30 days for 25 dollars.  A bargain.

Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

The mental health budget from Bali's governor was cut by 90% last year.\r\n\r\nThe few Indonesian psychological institutions that exist look more like a prision then a hospital. Patients are left by themselves and are even starving as there is not enough food. Check out: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RB3MJGjXoH4 (Indonesia's mentally ill mistreated and starving)\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of cases on Bali, where the families hide their mental ill family members, because they are ashamed. They believe mental illness is a curse, because of to little dedication to religion, and therefore it's a punishment by the gods. \r\n\r\nAs the mental ill patients sometimes show “strange“ behavior, their family puts them in heavy iron chains or lock them away in cages or wooden sheds for the rest of their lives. There are even reported cases that mental ill are brought to the jungle, where they die of starvation.\r\n",

Just 1 injection every 2 weeks can help a patient to live a relatively normal life, but these drugs are very expensive. Dr. Suryani visits her patients as much as she can and also educate their families, so they no longer lock them up. \r\n\r\nCheck out: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-NWiCViXc0 (The Dark Side of Paradise.

Sufferers are afflicted by an absence of melanin, a pigmentation defect in the hair, skin and eyes. It causes vulnerability to sun exposure and bright light. Many have very poor vision as a consequence. In tropical countries especially they can be vulnerable to skin cancers if unprotected from the sun.\r\n\r\nThough it might seem absurdly obvious, Albinism has nothing to do with magical powers. \r\n\r\nBut in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, albinos have traditionally faced discrimination and prejudice. They are associated with the supernatural. To some, a white-skinned African person is seen as a kind of phantom or ghost, who rather than die will dissolve or disappear with the wind and rain. \r\n\r\nOver the last five years in Tanzania, however, the situation has become much, much worse, with albinos increasingly subjected to murder and mutilation because of a completely absurd myth that albino body parts are effective in witchcraft rituals. Albino bones are also used as good luck charms and people believe they can make you rich.\r\n",
                "description": "Attacks on albinos continue, despite international outrage and repeated attempts by the Tanzanian government to stamp out this truly appalling practice, since it first came to light that many albinos have been hunted down and attacked purely for their limbs and organs. \r\n\r\nOfficially there are around 8,000 albinos registered by the Tanzania Albino Society (TAS), but they says the real number is in excess of 170,000. Many albinos are still kept hidden by their families because of the stigma or because of fear that they might be attacked.\r\n\r\nPlease check following documentary: http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/africainvestigates/2011/11/201111185428766652.html\r\nMeet two albino children, victims of vicious assault. A 12-year-old boy called Adam (see team photo), who had part of his hand cut off and a 16-year-old girl, whose arm was hacked off. Their body parts sold for witchcraft rituals or good luck charms. (You may find some of the images disturbing)\r\n\r\nMore info:\r\nTAS accepted the Martin Luther King Major Drum for Justice Award on behalf of albinos living in Tanzania in a ceremony at the US Embassy on January 15th 2009.\r\n\r\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7148673.stm\r\n\r\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/08/world/africa/08albino.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1\r\n\r\nhttp://www.add.org.uk/case_study.asp?ref=94\r\n",

In fact, our founder, Dudley Riggs, is one of the people credited with the invention of modern comedic improvisation. And he started performing it before Hawaii and Alaska could even be bothered to become states.\r\n\r\nToday, the Brave New Workshop Creative Outreach, led by John Sweeney, uses the positive aspects of the improvisation to transform businesses around the world. We tap into the same talent pool that have practiced, honed and perfected their skills on the Brave New Workshop stage and use them (like the actor slaves they are) to perform a variety of services including business training, humorous keynote speeches and scripted comedy. All because we truly believe that the principles of improvisation are, at their core, one of the greatest gifts we can pass along to help others improve their lives.",

                "description": "The Surrey Entrepreneurs is a student organisation based at the University of Surrey, our vision is to “Develop World Changing People” through encouraging enterprise within students. We use a variety of techniques to develop our members; \r\n\r\nSpeakers - to inspire, with the aim of giving our members enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nWorkshops - to educate, giving our members the key skills.\r\n\r\nNetworking - to connect, giving our members the contacts.\r\n\r\nProjects - to create, giving our members experience.\r\n\r\nWe feel that this balance of practical and theoretical learning coupled with peer lead support and encouragement puts our members on course for high achievement. We are committed to stimulating and enabling our students to believe that they have the capabilities and opportunities to develop themselves further. Whether this may be to increase their employability, commence their own venture or simply have a good time, everyone is welcome to contribute at the Surrey Entrepreneurs. \r\n\r\nWe feel “Entrepreneurship Will Change the World” and at Surrey we are in a prime position to take full advantage of this fundamental shift. With an ever growing student led initiative collaborating fully with the university and the Surrey Research Park opportunities to deliver the next generation of world changing people are endless. The Surrey Entrepreneurs has been working very closely with NACUE (National Consortium of University Entrepreneurs) through out the course of the year. Together establishing best practice, knowledge sharing and network contacts for the benefit of the greater enterprise community. We feel that this strong and strategic alliance is set to flourish and benefit both parties and entrepreneurship as a whole in the foreseeable future.",
