Everybody deserves access to financing - it is a basic need of all people in today's world.  However, the people who need it most in this world are being excluded. Most living here in the United States has much more than what they need. We can all spare a few dollars for a LOAN which will empower a poor person to effectively and responsibly counter the harsh realities of poverty by starting or expanding their own small business. Giving a loan without interest to a stranger across the world is definitely a charitable act - but this is not about charity with no end in sight.  Microloans are about empowering others who want to work for their survival but are less fortunate. Since commercial banks regard the poor as non-\"creditworthy\", it us up to us as compassionate individuals to do our part to help!    \r\n",
