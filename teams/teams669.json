Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

The GTZ/DED project “Sustainable Management of Natural Resources in Gorno-Badakhshan (Tajikistan)” will put a focus on the adaptation and dissemination of energy efficient technologies in the Pamir Mountains. It is part of the Regional Project to Support the Implementation of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UN CCD) in Central Asia.\r\n\r\nPeople in the Pamir region are increasingly suffering from a severe energy crisis. With the break down of the Soviet Empire, free of charge delivery of coal for all households in the region ceased and people now depend almost entirely on using scarce wood and manure as a substitute to coal. In the Western Pamirs the most important fuel is firewood from the degraded Riperian forests. In the Eastern Pamirs it is Teresken and dung, the former being a semi-shrub that helps prevent the erosion of pasture land in this yak and sheep rearing region.\r\n\r\nThe project will focus on simple and affordable thermal-insulation measures in private houses, efficient adapted cooking stoves, heat exchangers for existing inefficient metal box ovens and locally producible solar water heaters.\r\n\r\nAimed at a sustainable introduction and dissemination of energy efficient technologies, the project follows a market driven approach. Consequently the following elements will be supported:\r\n\r\n    Standardization of products and training of local producers in technical and business skills\r\n    Awareness building among the local population\r\n    A “warm comfort” microfinance product for the thermal-insulation of private houses, which will be reimbursed by the savings in fuel expenditure.

                "description": "In our team, we have a vision to change lives in novel ways. Our team's origin began with a Kiva Card (gift certificate) whose recipient founded this team. Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

We have no religious, racial or political affiliations of any kind. We want to encourage sustainable enterprises that recycle, reuse, repurpose and use environmentally sound agricultural and manufacturing practices. \r\nMany of us would like Kiva to develop environmental standards or criteria for their lending practices to prevent environmental impacts that would increase poverty for future generations.\r\nMany people want to have a green portfolio, or at least a green component. \r\nWon't you join us in creating true sustainability that includes a healthy environment?",

Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

We have no religious, racial or political affiliations of any kind. We want to encourage sustainable enterprises that recycle, reuse, repurpose and use environmentally sound agricultural and manufacturing practices. \r\nMany of us would like Kiva to develop environmental standards or criteria for their lending practices to prevent environmental impacts that would increase poverty for future generations.\r\nMany people want to have a green portfolio, or at least a green component. \r\nWon't you join us in creating true sustainability that includes a healthy environment?",
