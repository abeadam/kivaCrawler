She loved unconditionally, and was always ready with a hug, even for complete strangers.  The living memorial of sharing hugs began immediately after her death, when her mother told her classmates to hug each other every day in her memory.  This team keeps Becky's love alive by sharing her hugs in the form of loans around the world.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about Becky and the impact of her short life, visit BeckysHugs.com, which will point you to the Becky's Hugs page on Facebook.

Now we are continuing our involvement with Turame in an even more hands-on-way - by becoming microfinance lenders. \r\n\r\nHow to get involved:\r\n1. Click the join team button to the left [if you are new to Kiva you will need to create an account].\r\n\r\n2. Choose a Borrower: Check out the current Turame loans by scrolling down at this link: [http://bit.ly/pGU0sd] If there are no new loans, check back in as Turame posts new loans twice a month.\r\n\r\n3. Make a Loan:\r\n\r\n4. Get Repaid: Over the course of 6 months your loan will get repaid to you in the form of Kiva credit. [This is a loan, not a donation]\r\n\r\n5. Repeat.  You can take the money and put it back in your pocket or make a loan to another group.\r\n\r\nThanks for helping support Turame Community Finance in providing loans to those living in one of the poorest countries on the planet. \r\nYou can learn more about Turame here: www.kiva.org/partners/162",

McGivney, assistant pastor of St. Mary’s Church in New Haven and some of his parishioners, the Connecticut state legislature on March 29, 1882, officially chartered the Knights of Columbus as a fraternal benefit society. The Order is still true to its founding principles of charity, unity and fraternity.\r\n\r\nThe Knights was formed to render financial aid to members and their families. Mutual aid and assistance are offered to sick, disabled and needy members and their families. Social and intellectual fellowship is promoted among members and their families through educational, charitable, religious, social welfare, war relief and public relief works.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Order shows how the foresight of Father Michael J. McGivney, whose cause for sainthood is being investigated by the Vatican, brought about what has become the world's foremost Catholic fraternal benefit society. The Order has helped families obtain economic security and stability through its life insurance, annuity and long-term care programs, and has contributed time and energy worldwide to service in communities.\r\n\r\nThe Knights of Columbus has grown from several members in one council to more than 13,000 councils and 1.7 million members throughout the United States, Canada, the Philippines, Mexico, Poland, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Panama, the Bahamas, the Virgin Islands, Cuba, Guatemala, Guam and Saipan.\r\n",

                "description": "10 reasons to shop local\r\n…things to let your customers know\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Local shops sell a wide range of great products at affordable\r\nprices.\r\n\r\nMany people get out of the habit of shopping locally and are\r\nthen surprised by the range of products and gifts available.\r\n\r\n2. Shopping locally saves you money\r\n\r\nOut of town shops have done a good job of convincing us all that\r\nsole traders = expensive, but the evidence just isn’t there to back\r\nthis up. If you add in travel, parking costs, fees to transport larger\r\nitems home and customer time, the overall cost is often much\r\ngreater.\r\n\r\n3. Shopping locally retains our communities\r\n\r\nPeople don’t like losing shops and services in small towns and\r\nvillages but don’t equate this to how they spend their money. Shops\r\nwill only survive if customers spend locally – so if you want a vibrant\r\ntown centre, where people can socialise as well as shop, we need to\r\nencourage people to shop locally.\r\n\r\n4. Shopping locally retains our distinctiveness – avoid clone\r\ntowns!\r\n\r\nMany town centres in Britain look the same with franchises and\r\nmultinationals. Independent shops create distinctive shopping\r\nexperiences and stock different products. Independent shops keep\r\ntraditional local products alive. They respond more quickly to the\r\nneeds of local customers, stocking products to meet the changing\r\npopulation needs. They can also be more innovative…….organic\r\nproducts were first developed by independent traders!\r\n\r\n5. Shopping locally saves the environment\r\n\r\nWe are all aware of CO2 emissions and our environmental impact.\r\nLocal shops often stock a higher percentage of locally sourced goods\r\nfor which distribution time and customer journey times are reduced.\r\nThis helps reduce our global footprint.\r\n\r\n6. Shopping locally creates jobs\r\n\r\nShops in our town centres and villages create local employment and\r\nself employment. These people in turn spend in the local economy.\r\nOver half a million people are employed in retail in our rural towns\r\nand villages. Evidence shows that for every £10 spent in an\r\nindependent shop, £25 is generated for the local economy compared\r\nto £14 spent in multinationals.\r\n\r\n7. Local independent shops invest more in our communities\r\n\r\nSole traders and independent stores are proportionally more\r\ngenerous in their support for local charities, carnivals, schools and\r\ncommunity events. So supporting local shops means a financial\r\nreturn for our community.\r\n\r\n8. Local shops are for everyone\r\n\r\nMost people can get to their local shops easily. This is especially\r\nimportant for the elderly, the vulnerable, young people and those\r\nwithout private transport. Keeping your shops open by buying locally\r\nhelps the whole community.\r\n\r\n9. Local shops value you more\r\n\r\nEvidence from numerous surveys shows people receive better\r\ncustomer care and service in local shops. Traders survive by their\r\nreputation and repeat business – so shopping locally means that you\r\nget a higher standard of service.\r\n\r\n10. Shopping locally saves services\r\n\r\nPrivate, voluntary and public sector services cluster around shops.\r\nThe loss of the high street often corresponds to a reduction in these\r\nservices. As shops disappear, so do hairdressers, vets, dentists etc",

We are giving to KIVA because we believe in personally connecting with entrepreneurs by empowering them to improve their own lives and the lives of those around them through lending.
