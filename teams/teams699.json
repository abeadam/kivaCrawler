The mental health budget from Bali's governor was cut by 90% last year.\r\n\r\nThe few Indonesian psychological institutions that exist look more like a prision then a hospital. Patients are left by themselves and are even starving as there is not enough food. Check out: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RB3MJGjXoH4 (Indonesia's mentally ill mistreated and starving)\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of cases on Bali, where the families hide their mental ill family members, because they are ashamed. They believe mental illness is a curse, because of to little dedication to religion, and therefore it's a punishment by the gods. \r\n\r\nAs the mental ill patients sometimes show “strange“ behavior, their family puts them in heavy iron chains or lock them away in cages or wooden sheds for the rest of their lives. There are even reported cases that mental ill are brought to the jungle, where they die of starvation.\r\n",

Just 1 injection every 2 weeks can help a patient to live a relatively normal life, but these drugs are very expensive. Dr. Suryani visits her patients as much as she can and also educate their families, so they no longer lock them up. \r\n\r\nCheck out: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-NWiCViXc0 (The Dark Side of Paradise. Mental Illness in Bali) and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCxmuEf7lM (101East – Bali breakdown) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXzyqU-x52c&feature=related (Bali's Shame)\r\n\r\nDr. Suryani is also president of the CASA organization, a Committee Against Sexual Abuse. Bali sees a rising number of foreign pedofiles, who are abusing children from remote areas, pretending to be “sugar daddies“. \r\n",

Personal involvement with innocent suffering, with the injustice others suffer, is the catalyst for solidarity which then gives rise to intellectual inquiry and moral reflection...Students, in the course of their formation, must let the gritty reality of this world into their lives, so they can learn to feel it, think about it critically, respond to its suffering and engage it constructively. They should learn to perceive, think, judge, choose and act for the rights of others, especially the disadvantaged and the oppressed. --by Peter-Hans Kolvenbach, SJ, from \"The Service of Faith and the Promotion of Justice in American Jesuit Higher Education\"\r\n\r\n",

It serves as a trade crossroad and a trans-shipment point between the Europe and Asia as before when it used to be a connecting-link between north and south directions of Silk Way. \r\n\r\nThe economy of Kyrgyzstan was severely affected by the collapse of the Soviet trading block. More than 20% of the Kyrgyz population has left to other parts of the Soviet Union within past 10 years to seek work.\r\n\r\nWhile strong growth in neighboring Kazakhstan and China has created opportunities for expansion, Kyrgyzstan remains a small economy vulnerable to external shocks. Persistently high inflation, coupled with the global financial crisis, threatens to undermine recent improvements in poverty levels.",
