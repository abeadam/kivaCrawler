I am still trying to get the mail stopped and our number off the call lists.\r\n\r\nTo keep up the helping and cut down on the fundraiser overhead I have been lending money on KIVA.\r\n\r\nKiva's mission is to connect people, through lending, for the sake of alleviating poverty.\r\n\r\nKiva empowers individuals to lend to an entrepreneur across the globe. By combining microfinance with the internet, Kiva is creating a global community of people connected through lending.\r\n\r\nKiva was born of the following beliefs:\r\nPeople are by nature generous, and will help others if given the opportunity to do so in a transparent, accountable way.\r\n\r\nThe poor are highly motivated and can be very successful when given an opportunity.\r\n\r\nBy connecting people we can create relationships beyond financial transactions, and build a global community expressing support and encouragement of one another.\r\n\r\nKiva promotes:\r\nDignity:   Kiva encourages partnership relationships as opposed to benefactor relationships. Partnership relationships are characterized by mutual dignity and respect.\r\n\r\nAccountability:   Loans encourage more accountability than donations where repayment is not expected.\r\n\r\nTransparency:   The Kiva website is an open platform where communication can flow freely around the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis way I can keep up Dorothea's giving without giving the money away and use it over and over. To keep Dorothea in our minds and hearts I have started a KIVA Team \"Dorothea's Legacy\" where we can as a group help other people in Dorothea's name.\r\n\r\nI will be sending you an invitation to join us in KIVA and to join the team. I have been sending gift certificates for birthday presents. The gift certificate is good only for lending in KIVA but after it has been repaid it can then either be re-loaned or taken out with pay pal.\r\n\r\nThis is not a scam. It will not make anyone money. It is not a gift. If you have some money that you could spare for six months or so, why not lend it to some one who can make good use of it. It will not cost you and it feels right.\r\n",
