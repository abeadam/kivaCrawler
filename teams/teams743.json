Once you're a part of the team, you can choose to have a future loan on Kiva \"count\" towards our team's impact. The loan is still yours, and repayments still come to you. You can also choose to have the loan show up in our team's collective portfolio, so our team's overall impact will grow!\r\n\r\nImportant Team Disclosure:  Kiva loans are not securities. Kiva does not guarantee lenders that their loans will be repaid, and Kiva does not pay interest to lenders. Kiva lenders should have no expectation of a financial return on their loans.

Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

We look for loans that are about to expire by using the Sort By:\r\n\"Expiring Soon\" option instead of the default \"Popularity\", and then work to get them funded.\r\n\r\nSee our team FAQ, linked above (the \"Team Website\" button, next to our traffic light avatar).\r\n\r\nA Team LLL glossary (contributed by team member Tony):\r\n\r\nRed Loans: Loans that have less than five days to be funded, identifiable by the red box with the notice that says \"Only x days left!\" or \r\n\"Only x hours and y minutes left!\"\r\n\r\nLLL - Late Loaning Lenders: this team, where \r\nlenders work together to keep loans from \r\nexpiring.\r\n\r\nSFDD - Starfish Daily Dozen: Under current \r\npractice, one of these lists is prepared and \r\nposted for each day, to help LLL lenders focus \r\nand coordinate their lending on a targeted \r\ngroup of loans (the Starfish or SF). The lists \r\nare prepared by a group of volunteers who \r\nseek to be objective in selecting the loans to \r\nbe included in their lists. They also seek to \r\nspread out the loans in each list over a 24 hour \r\nperiod and to share the joy among the Field \r\nPartners with loans expiring during that period, \r\nbut their efforts are always constrained by the \r\nchoice of loans that are available for inclusion \r\nin the list. Loans with larger amounts needed \r\nwill be included in the period immediately after \r\neach Credit Day, when lenders are feeling \r\nflush, but the lists will become less ambitious \r\nwhen the LLL lenders are feeling poor.\r\n\r\nGG - Gorgeous Group: The SFDD list-makers usually add one or two of these loans at the end of the SF daily dozen lists. As the name \r\nimplies, only group loans are picked. When it is \r\nfirst posted, a typical GG loan will expire two \r\ndays or more after the list is posted. It will \r\nusually be retained as a GG until it becomes \r\nFully Funded or moves into Starfish range. The amount needed when the loan is selected as a GG will vary depending on the time of month.\r\n\r\nOPM - Abbreviation for \"other people's money.\"  Our main lending method is to coordinate LLL team members' loans, so that we make several loans to a borrower within a short period of time. This will move the borrower's loan request up in Kiva's \"popularity\" sort and get the loan noticed by other people (non-members of the LLL team).  Many loans then get their funding completed by loans from those non-LLL members.  By attracting other lenders' attention to our Starfish loans in this way, we multiply the impact of our finite funds, and save more loans from expiring than we otherwise could.\r\n\r\nRTR - Reduce the Red: These lists are \r\nprepared and posted when there are large \r\nnumbers of loans slated to expire in a short \r\nperiod of time. \"Red\" is a reference to the red \r\nboxes that are added to a loan description \r\nwhen the Loan is about to expire without full \r\nfunding.\r\n\r\nBulge: A short period in which a great many loans have their scheduled funding expiration times. This may happen when, for example, the volunteer coordinators at Kiva offer a promo of some kind to the editors & translators, to get them to do a lot of work in a very short period of time. Bulge loans are prime candidates for inclusion in Reduce the Red lists.\r\n\r\nBTB - Battling the Boxes: On those days where \r\nthere aren't 12 loans that qualify as \"Starfish,\" the listmakers will include loans that have their red boxes, but more than 24 hours left before their deadline, to make up the 12 loans for the list. The criteria are similar to SF \r\nloans, i.e., one per field partner and reasonable \r\namounts left to fund (not too much; not too \r\nlittle), except that these loans may have a longer time left before their expiry date. If they gain good traction on their first BTB day, they may be carried forward. If not ... they stand a second chance as SF.\r\n\r\nFF - Fully Funded: This is LLL code for a loan \r\nthat has received all the loans required for it to be removed from the list of loans that are raising funds \r\nand to move into paying back status.\r\n\r\nLars Ratio: the average funding per hour that is needed for a loan to become fully funded.\r\n(Developed by team member Lars)\r\n\r\nWiedergänger (contributed by Maria) - German expression, literal translation \"again walker,\" meaning \"undead,\" i.e. a person that has died but comes back, aka a zombie. Here it means a loan that disappears from the page, but comes back again because somebody didn't check out their basket.\r\n\r\nRuma sana (contributed by Jouko and Potkukelkka) - Finnish expression, literal translation \"ugly words.\"  It is a phrase to use when you are very frustrated, but want to stop just short of actual cursing -- for example, when the Kiva site repeatedly logs you out when you are trying to rescue an expiring loan at the last second.\r\n\r\nSee data about all loans currently fundraising on Kiva:\r\nwww.kivatools.com\r\nSee data about loans that have been mentioned on the LLL board, including the most recent lending activity on each loan:\r\nhttp://starfish.dynalias.org/\r\nSee loans in real time, as they are made:\r\nhttp://www.http://kivalive.com/index2.php\r\n\r\nLists are posted on the LLL Team message \r\nboard.

This is a forum to notify each other of environmentally sustainable loans that are needing funding. Sustainable development projects include recycling, solar, re-use, organic agriculture, health, etc. \r\n\r\nWe support enterprises that care about the earth and all of its inhabitants. We have no religious, racial or political affiliations of any kind. We want to encourage sustainable enterprises that recycle, reuse, repurpose and use environmentally sound agricultural and manufacturing practices. \r\nMany of us would like Kiva to develop environmental standards or criteria for their lending practices to prevent environmental impacts that would increase poverty for future generations.\r\nMany people want to have a green portfolio, or at least a green component. \r\nWon't you join us in creating true sustainability that includes a healthy environment?",

IT WAS FORMED TO EMPOWER THE LIVES OF THOSE WHO LIVES IN SLUMS .TO LIVE ABOVE POVERTY LEVEL.MOST OF THIS PEOPLE LIVE BELOW POVERY LEVEL THAT IS TO SAY MOST OF THEM CAN LIVE UP TO ONE WEEK WITHOUT GETTING ONE DOLLAR. \r\nTHERE IS A BIG GAP BETWEEN THEN AND THE RICH THAT MAKE THESE PEOPLE TO CONTINUE TO LIVE IN THIS HARD LIFE COMOCEI, WILL WORK AND ACT AS BRIDGE BETWEEN THE RICH AND THE POOR AND AS WE EMPOWER THEM WILL TEACH THEM HOW TO ELEVATE THEIR LIVES AND BRIDGE THAT GAP. THAT AS PER NOW ITS VERY WIDE.THE COMICEI WAS STARTED BY GROUP OF EXPERT AND VOLUNTEER OF WHOM SOME ARE MEMBERS OR VOLUNTEER CHRISTIAN.ORG AND TECHMISION.ORG AND URBANMINISTRY.ORG THEY ARE ALL FROM JESUS WORKING POWER CENTRE VOLUNTEER GROUP THEY WERE LOOKING UNTO WAY TO TO MAKE THE POOR TO RISE ROM POVERTY AND LIVE GOOD LIFE ABOVE POVERTY LINE. \r\nTHE GROUP COMICEI WORKS WITH EXPERTS AND VOLUTEER WHOARE SKILLED TO TEACH AND TRAIN AND SUPERVISE ALL THAT IS HAPENING HERE ON THE GROUND .THEY ARE THOSE WHO MADE THE VISION OF COMICEI TO BE BIRTHED .THEY DID RESERCH AND CAME TO LEARN TO

CAN NOT A FORD THINGS LIKE CLOTHS FOOD ND EVEN GOOD HOUSE TO LIVE IN DUE TO STIGMA OF POVERTY .THIS HAS LEAD TO MOST OF SINGLES LADIES WHO LIVES IN SLUMS TO DO THINGS LIKE PROSTITUTION AND THAT LEADS TO MOST OF THE GIRL CHILD FROM THOSE PLACES TO DROP OUT OF SCHOOL AND EARLY AGE AND THAT ALSO LEADS TO CHILD LABOUR GET RISK OF GETING HIV AIDS YOU WILL FIND MANY YOUNG CHILDREN WORKING AT AVERY EARLY AGE .THE YOUTHS FROM THE SAME SINGLE PARENTS MOST OF THEM RESORT TO THINGS LIKE BAD GUNGS AND ALSO DRUGS AND WRONG WORK TO BE ABLE TO GET AT LIST MONEY TO EAT .THE POVERTY LEVEL IN SLUMS AND RURAL HAS

PEOPLE THEY WILL NOT FIGHT OR BE USED BY POLITICIANS DURING THE ELECTION TIME.COMICEI VISION IS O SE THAT POVERTY IS MAKE HISTORY ND MANY WHO LIVES IN SLUMS AND RURAL ARE EMPOWERED TO LIVE NORMAL LIFE LIKE OTHERS AND BY SO DOING, THE WORLD HERE IN KENYA WILL BE GOOD PLACE TO LIVE IN.POVERTY CAN ALSO BE DEFINED AS THE REASON THAT IS LEADING MOST OF KENYANS TO BE CORRUPT .AS SOME ONE WHO WAS LUCKY TO GET EMPLOYED IN GOVERMENT BUT HE LOOKS AT HIS POVERTY HOME HE WILL LOOK FOR SHORT CUT TO MAKE MONEY SO THAT THEY DOS NOT BECOME POOR BACK HOME . \r\nERADICATE POVERTY AND SEE CORRUPTION FINISHED THE HARD LIFE LEADS MOST OF THOSE WHO ARE POOR TO DO BAD THINGS COMICEI INITIATIVE IS O EMPOWER THOSE WHO LIVES IN SLUMS TO LIVE ABOVE POVERTY LEVEL AND HAT WILL BEGIN FROM GRASS ROOT LEVEL FROM SLUMS TO

EVERY ONE ON TOP THERE ONCE LIVES IN SLUM OR RURAL I APPEAL TO THEM TO LIFT OUR HANDS TO SEE THIS VISION COME TO PASS \r\nCOMICEI WAS BIRTHED AFTER 2007 ELECTION THAT MANY PATS OF OUR COUNTRY PEOPLE DIED AND MANY UP TO NOW STILL LIVES IN IDPS CAMPS AND THOSE WHO REMAINED IN SLUMS HAVE AVERY HARD LIFE WHICH SOMETHING MUST BE DONE TO EMPOWER THEM .THE YOUTHS AND GIRLS SUFFERED AND MOST OF HEM WEE KILLED SOME OF THE GIRLS WERE PREGNATED AND OTHERS GOT HIV AIDS VIRUS \r\nPOVERTY IS THE ROUTE COURSE OF THIS AT THAT TIME OF WAR MOST OF THE YOUTHS AND HE GIRLS TURNED TO BAD LIFE AS WE EMPOWER THEM

                "description": "Alan's account of the founding of LLL is on the  team board @Alan re: #260143. Loans that are nearing expiry won't get funded if they don't get noticed. We look for loans that are about to expire by using the Sort By:\r\n\"Expiring Soon\" option instead of the default \"Popularity\", and then work to get them funded.\r\n\r\nSee our team FAQ, linked above (the \"Team Website\" button, next to our traffic light avatar).\r\n\r\nA Team LLL glossary (contributed by team member Tony):\r\n\r\nRed Loans: Loans that have less than five days to be funded, identifiable by the red box with the notice that says \"Only x days left!\" or \r\n\"Only x hours and y minutes left!\"\r\n\r\nLLL - Late Loaning Lenders: this team, where \r\nlenders work together to keep loans from \r\nexpiring.\r\n\r\nSFDD - Starfish Daily Dozen: Under current \r\npractice, one of these lists is prepared and \r\nposted for each day, to help LLL lenders focus \r\nand coordinate their lending on a targeted \r\ngroup of loans (the Starfish or SF). The lists \r\nare prepared by a group of volunteers who \r\nseek to be objective in selecting the loans to \r\nbe included in their lists. They also seek to \r\nspread out the loans in each list over a 24 hour \r\nperiod and to share the joy among the Field \r\nPartners with loans expiring during that period, \r\nbut their efforts are always constrained by the \r\nchoice of loans that are available for inclusion \r\nin the list. Loans with larger amounts needed \r\nwill be included in the period immediately after \r\neach Credit Day, when lenders are feeling \r\nflush, but the lists will become less ambitious \r\nwhen the LLL lenders are feeling poor.\r\n\r\nGG - Gorgeous Group: The SFDD list-makers usually add one or two of these loans at the end of the SF daily dozen lists. As the name \r\nimplies, only group loans are picked. When it is \r\nfirst posted, a typical GG loan will expire two \r\ndays or more after the list is posted. It will \r\nusually be retained as a GG until it becomes \r\nFully Funded or moves into Starfish range. The amount needed when the loan is selected as a GG will vary depending on the time of month.\r\n\r\nOPM - Abbreviation for \"other people's money.\"  Our main lending method is to coordinate LLL team members' loans, so that we make several loans to a borrower within a short period of time. This will move the borrower's loan request up in Kiva's \"popularity\" sort and get the loan noticed by other people (non-members of the LLL team).  Many loans then get their funding completed by loans from those non-LLL members.  By attracting other lenders' attention to our Starfish loans in this way, we multiply the impact of our finite funds, and save more loans from expiring than we otherwise could.\r\n\r\nRTR - Reduce the Red: These lists are \r\nprepared and posted when there are large \r\nnumbers of loans slated to expire in a short \r\nperiod of time. \"Red\" is a reference to the red \r\nboxes that are added to a loan description \r\nwhen the Loan is about to expire without full \r\nfunding.\r\n\r\nBulge: A short period in which a great many loans have their scheduled funding expiration times. This may happen when, for example, the volunteer coordinators at Kiva offer a promo of some kind to the editors & translators, to get them to do a lot of work in a very short period of time. Bulge loans are prime candidates for inclusion in Reduce the Red lists.\r\n\r\nBTB - Battling the Boxes: On those days where \r\nthere aren't 12 loans that qualify as \"Starfish,\" the listmakers will include loans that have their red boxes, but more than 24 hours left before their deadline, to make up the 12 loans for the list. The criteria are similar to SF \r\nloans, i.e., one per field partner and reasonable \r\namounts left to fund (not too much; not too \r\nlittle), except that these loans may have a longer time left before their expiry date. If they gain good traction on their first BTB day, they may be carried forward. If not ... they stand a second chance as SF.\r\n\r\nFF - Fully Funded: This is LLL code for a loan \r\nthat has received all the loans required for it to be removed from the list of loans that are raising funds \r\nand to move into paying back status.\r\n\r\nLars Ratio: the average funding per hour that is needed for a loan to become fully funded.\r\n(Developed by team member Lars)\r\n\r\nWiedergänger (contributed by Maria) - German expression, literal translation \"again walker,\" meaning \"undead,\" i.e. a person that has died but comes back, aka a zombie. Here it means a loan that disappears from the page, but comes back again because somebody didn't check out their basket.\r\n\r\nRuma sana (contributed by Jouko and Potkukelkka) - Finnish expression, literal translation \"ugly words.\"  It is a phrase to use when you are very frustrated, but want to stop just short of actual cursing -- for example, when the Kiva site repeatedly logs you out when you are trying to rescue an expiring loan at the last second.\r\n\r\nSee data about all loans currently fundraising on Kiva:\r\nwww.kivatools.com\r\nSee data about loans that have been mentioned on the LLL board, including the most recent lending activity on each loan:\r\nhttp://starfish.dynalias.org/\r\nSee loans in real time, as they are made:\r\nhttp://www.http://kivalive.com/index2.php\r\n\r\nLists are posted on the LLL Team message \r\nboard.
