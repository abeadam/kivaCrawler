Reproduction is used, consciously or not, as a means to control women, to limit their options and to make them subordinate to men. In many societies a serious approach to reproductive health has to have this perspective in mind. We must seek to liberate women.\" -  Dr. Nafis Sadik Executive Director, UN Population Fund - \r\n\r\n**** THE IMPORTANCE OF GOOD HEALTH & EDUCATION TO A WOMAN'S WELL-BEING - AND THAT OF HER FAMILY & SOCIETY - CANNOT BE OVERSTATED. \r\n\r\n - - Without reproductive health and freedom, women cannot fully exercise their fundamental human rights, such as those relating to education and employment. Yet around the world, the right to health, and especially reproductive and sexual health, is far from a reality for many women. According to the World Bank, a full one-third of the illness among women ages 15-44 in developing countries is related to pregnancy, childbirth, abortion, reproductive tract infections, and human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS).  Women's disproportionate poverty, low social status, and reproductive role expose them to high health risks, resulting in needless and largely preventable suffering and deaths. Many of the women and girls who die each year during pregnancy and childbirth could have been saved by relatively low-cost improvements in reproductive healthcare; yet high levels of maternal mortality persist. The benefits of eliminating the harmful and painful practice of female genital mutilation are easily demonstrated, yet it persists for cultural and traditional reasons. And a large proportion of abortions, some resulting in death and injury, would be avoided if women and men had access to safe, affordable and effective means of contraception. - -       \r\nhttp://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/women/womrepro.htm - - - - - - - - \r\n\r\n**** EVERY MINUTE, A WOMAN DIES IN PREGNANCY OR CHILDBIRTH - -  this adds up to more than 10 million over a generation. - - Almost all of these women - 99 per cent - live and die in developing countries. A high maternal death rate is an indicator of an inadequate health care system, including those that offer poor and only limited access to health services. It also indicates that a woman’s fundamental rights to life and health are being violated. - - - Yet the vast majority of maternal deaths could be prevented. In industrialized countries, deaths owing to pregnancy and childbirth are rare. The maternal death rate in East Asia and Latin America has also decreased - by as much as 50 per cent in some countries. But in Africa and South Asia, complications during pregnancy and childbirth remain the most frequent cause of death for women. - - In some countries the number is increasing. And when women suffer and die, children suffer and die also. - - We know what it takes to save women’s lives: universal access to contraception to avoid unintended pregnancies, access to skilled care during delivery, and rapid access to quality emergency obstetric care when required. - - - - - \r\n\r\n**** THE CURRENT SITUATION  •  Every year, 536,000 women die from pregnancy related causes. This adds up to more than 10 million women over a generation. Every year, more than 1 million children are left motherless and vulnerable because of maternal death.  Children who have lost their mothers are up to 10 times more likely to die prematurely than those who haven’t. The risk of a woman dying as a result of pregnancy or childbirth during her lifetime is about 1 in 7 in Niger and about 1 in 48,000 in Ireland. 10-15 million women a year suffer severe or long-lasting illnesses or disabilities caused by complications during pregnancy or childbirth. These range from obstetric fistula to infertility and depression. The main reasons for maternal deaths are haemorrhage, infections, unsafe abortions, high blood pressure leading to seizures and obstructed labor. - - - - \r\n\r\n**** CONTRACEPTION & UNSAFE ABORTIONS - - - -  200 million women want to delay or avoid pregnancy but are not using effective contraceptives. One in three deaths related to pregnancy and childbirth could be avoided if women who wanted effective contraception had access to it. An estimated 19 million unsafe abortions take place each year in developing countries. Every year, an estimated 68,000 women die as the result of unsafe abortions and millions more suffer complications. About 90% of abortion-related deaths and disabilities worldwide could be avoided if women who wished to had access to effective contraception. - - -  \r\n\r\n*** SKILLED ASSISTANCE & EMERGENCY OBSTETRIC CARE • The number of maternal deaths is highest in countries where women are least likely to have skilled attendance at delivery. • Worldwide, 62 per cent of births are attended by a skilled health worker. Almost all births in developed countries are attended. In less developed countries, the figure is 57 per cent. In least developed countries it falls to only 34 per cent. • An estimated 35 per cent of pregnant women in developing countries do not have contact with health personnel prior to giving birth. • In sub-Saharan Africa, where most maternal deaths occur, about 70 per cent have no contact with health personnel following childbirth. • Mortality is highest during labour and the two days following a birth. • Women who undergo infibulation—a radical form of female genital mutilation that involves stitching of the external genitalia—are at higher risk of complications during and following childbirth - -  http://www.unfpa.org/safemotherhood/mediakit/documents/fs/factsheet1_eng.pdf",

A sort of catch-all the accepts everyone no matter what your interests, location, or background.\r\n\r\nOne of the best videos on microfinance: www.goo.gl/sVkdK4 It's of Muhammad Yunus, the developer of microfinance.\r\n\r\nWe want to grow Kiva by inviting people to it.  Kiva's invite rate is 0.28 (as of 1.17.13). If we could bring that to 1.0 or near 1.0, Kiva would grow near exponentially.  All a 1.0 invite rate means is that each person on Kiva successfully invites just one other new person to Kiva.  I know we can do it. You can generally invite people to Kiva here: https://www.kiva.org/portfolio/invites  or specifically to team Universe and Kiva here: http://www.kiva.org/team/universe/recruit\r\n\r\nAnother interesting tidbit: \"The microfinance sector currently has an estimated total loan volume of USD 25 bn. Yet, it is unable to serve more than a fraction (~100 m) of today's total sector demand of roughly 1 bn micro-borrowers. This situation translates into an immense funding gap estimated at around USD 250 bn.\" see www.goo.gl/Lg6hIC\r\n\r\nWe want our team to be a catch all that anyone with any interest can join. But we also want to invite tons of other people to join Kiva. Let's make Kiva grow.\r\n\r\n***** There might be free $25 loan if someone accepts your invite. Go to: https://www.kiva.org/portfolio/invites\r\n\r\nAnother name for our team could be \"All\" or \"Other\" because we are a catch all for anything and everything else.  Everyone is encouraged to join this team, no matter what your interests.\r\n\r\nSure, we want to lend to others. But perhaps even more important is to invite all of our friends through email, Facebook, and whatever else.\r\n\r\nWe want more and more people to use Kiva through whatever means available, including telling our friends, Kiva gifts cards, Twitter, and, when available, the free $25 first-timer loans: https://www.kiva.org/portfolio/invites\r\n\r\nMy story is an interesting example: I've invited hundreds, if not thousands of people, primarily by using my email contacts, but also through Facebook. I've only been able to make 33 loans so far, but my successful invitees have collectively made 34 loans.  Out of the hundreds or thousand of invites I've sent out, only 3 have been successful.  But those invites have had a greater total dollar impact than my own lending.\r\n\r\nWhen you look at the successful invites that my invites have sent, the impact is even greater.\r\n\r\nMost of us can make a little difference by lending a little of our money, but we can make a huge difference by getting a few of our friends to lend a little money as well, and then passing it on down the line.\r\n\r\nMy journey with Kiva all started with my sister giving me a gift card, it took almost the whole year, just before it expired, for me to even use it. Don't get discouraged if your invites seem to go unnoticed. It might take thousands of invites before someone accepts and makes their first loan.  But that person might be Bill Gates, or might invite Bill Gates.\r\n\r\nI don't think most people join Kiva because they stumbled upon it, they join it because they were invited by someone just like you.\r\n\r\nWere you invited to Kiva?",
