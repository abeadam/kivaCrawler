We are not at all perfect but we all have a vision of a perfect world. How do we manifest our vision? by utilizing the most wonderful resources God has given us...US! We are our own catalyst for change. Change begins with us and everything currently occurring in the world proves that it is currently time to change. As of today it is no longer important to focus on personal issues, on who is wrong or right or who did what. The earth is changing and we must change with her.\r\n\r\nTime is of the essence and our spirits tell us that we should begin to support one another whatever way possible. To eliminate, poverty, hunger, crime, drugs etc we must first remove the conditions which lead many in the world to such desperate measures. By just helping one citizen of earth across the ocean build a business of their own and live their dreams, We are aiding in the co-creation of a new life, new dreams, a new earth. Join our lending team and give whatever you can whenever you can. As a member of the starseed network lending team you can make a powerful impact as a team. The more people involved the stronger the energy of change will be. Unite as one to give to many!\r\n\r\nGandhi once said: Be the change you wish to see in the world. This change begins with us! this is why we are here! Get involved in ending poverty and watch not only the lives of strangers across the world grow and flourish but also our own. The energy you put out is the energy you will receive. Let us unite to bring positive energy in to the world. Through our efforts we can begin the process of 5D earth, right here right now.",

Whether we are Jewish or Greek, slave or free, God gave all of us one Spirit to drink. As you know, the human body is not made up of only one part, but of many parts. Suppose a foot says, \"I'm not a hand, so I'm not part of the body!\" Would that mean it's no longer part of the body? Or suppose an ear says, \"I'm not an eye, so I'm not a part of the body!\" Would that mean it's no longer part of the body? If the whole body were an eye, how could it hear? If the whole body were an ear, how could it smell? So God put each and every part of the body together as he wanted it. How could it be a body if it only had one part? So there are many parts but one body.\"\r\n(God's Word Translation 1995)",

This is a forum to notify each other of environmentally sustainable loans that are needing funding. Sustainable development projects include recycling, solar, re-use, organic agriculture, health, etc. \r\n\r\nWe support enterprises that care about the earth and all of its inhabitants. We have no religious, racial or political affiliations of any kind. We want to encourage sustainable enterprises that recycle, reuse, repurpose and use environmentally sound agricultural and manufacturing practices. \r\nMany of us would like Kiva to develop environmental standards or criteria for their lending practices to prevent environmental impacts that would increase poverty for future generations.\r\nMany people want to have a green portfolio, or at least a green component. \r\nWon't you join us in creating true sustainability that includes a healthy environment?",
