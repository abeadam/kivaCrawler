So you can consider, that your loan 'interest' ( let's say 10% annual) from this amount ( equal 10$) will went to charity. So if you want to donate ~10$/month to charity, what you need to do is to lend 100$/month every of 12 months.  Then after 1 year you just need to keep re-lending same money again or add/withdraw a little, according to your wage changes.  Can you do 10% from your wage? That's what most religions recommend to share. \r\nLooks a lot? But we are offering NOT to share, but just To LEND 10% without interest. Which is equal to 0.83% of your wage will be donated. \r\n Can we? No? Ok. Can we start with commitment for 1% of wage lended, until our awareness will rise?\r\nDo you feel like getting above average World person?\r\n  Keep in mind, there is a small risk of no return as well, which you can adjust next year!\r\n You can add gift certificates as well.",

Check the facts about Poorest country! http://myrayana.blogspot.com/2011/03/top-10-poorest-countries-in-world-2011.html\r\n\r\n2) Read Empowering report http://Sn.im/EthicMoney:\r\n2.1) Let's Think SPENDING money as a voting tickets.

Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

So you can consider, that your loan 'interest' ( let's say 10% annual) from this amount ( equal 10$) will went to charity. So if you want to donate ~10$/month to charity, what you need to do is to lend 100$/month every of 12 months.  Then after 1 year you just need to keep re-lending same money again or add/withdraw a little, according to your wage changes.  Can you do 10% from your wage? That's what most religions recommend to share. \r\nLooks a lot? But we are offering NOT to share, but just To LEND 10% without interest. Which is equal to 0.83% of your wage will be donated. \r\n Can we? No? Ok. Can we start with commitment for 1% of wage lended, until our awareness will rise?\r\nDo you feel like getting above average World person?\r\n  Keep in mind, there is a small risk of no return as well, which you can adjust next year!\r\n You can add gift certificates as well.",

Check the facts about Poorest country! http://myrayana.blogspot.com/2011/03/top-10-poorest-countries-in-world-2011.html\r\n\r\n2) Read Empowering report http://Sn.im/EthicMoney:\r\n2.1) Let's Think SPENDING money as a voting tickets.

So you can consider, that your loan 'interest' ( let's say 10% annual) from this amount ( equal 10$) will went to charity. So if you want to donate ~10$/month to charity, what you need to do is to lend 100$/month every of 12 months.  Then after 1 year you just need to keep re-lending same money again or add/withdraw a little, according to your wage changes.  Can you do 10% from your wage? That's what most religions recommend to share. \r\nLooks a lot? But we are offering NOT to share, but just To LEND 10% without interest. Which is equal to 0.83% of your wage will be donated. \r\n Can we? No? Ok. Can we start with commitment for 1% of wage lended, until our awareness will rise?\r\nDo you feel like getting above average World person?\r\n  Keep in mind, there is a small risk of no return as well, which you can adjust next year!\r\n You can add gift certificates as well.",

Check the facts about Poorest country! http://myrayana.blogspot.com/2011/03/top-10-poorest-countries-in-world-2011.html\r\n\r\n2) Read Empowering report http://Sn.im/EthicMoney:\r\n2.1) Let's Think SPENDING money as a voting tickets.

Half world population is living with 2.5$/day or less.\r\n\r\nIf you feeling PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE for lack of World Social Welfare system,\r\n you can commit to lend percentage of your earnings (5-10% recommended) straight to poorest.\r\n\r\nHow to think this Kiva microlending project is as a charity?\r\n Actually it becomes close to best charity!\r\nExample:\r\nLet's say you've commited \r\nto lend 5% of your wage  which is 100$ for 1 month. So you can consider, that your loan 'interest' ( let's say 10% annual) from this amount ( equal 10$) will went to charity. So if you want to donate ~10$/month to charity, what you need to do is to lend 100$/month every of 12 months.  Then after 1 year you just need to keep re-lending same money again or add/withdraw a little, according to your wage changes.  Can you do 10% from your wage? That's what most religions recommend to share. \r\nLooks a lot? But we are offering NOT to share, but just To LEND 10% without interest. Which is equal to 0.83% of your wage will be donated. \r\n Can we? No? Ok. Can we start with commitment for 1% of wage lended, until our awareness will rise?\r\nDo you feel like getting above average World person?\r\n  Keep in mind, there is a small risk of no return as well, which you can adjust next year!\r\n You can add gift certificates as well.",

Check the facts about Poorest country! http://myrayana.blogspot.com/2011/03/top-10-poorest-countries-in-world-2011.html\r\n\r\n2) Read Empowering report http://Sn.im/EthicMoney:\r\n2.1) Let's Think SPENDING money as a voting tickets. Voting becomes as a promoting industries.  So what you promote?\r\n2.2) Let's Think EARNING money as cooperating your time, knowledge, other resources with some industries.

So you can consider, that your loan 'interest' ( let's say 10% annual) from this amount ( equal 10$) will went to charity. So if you want to donate ~10$/month to charity, what you need to do is to lend 100$/month every of 12 months.  Then after 1 year you just need to keep re-lending same money again or add/withdraw a little, according to your wage changes.  Can you do 10% from your wage? That's what most religions recommend to share. \r\nLooks a lot? But we are offering NOT to share, but just To LEND 10% without interest. Which is equal to 0.83% of your wage will be donated. \r\n Can we? No? Ok. Can we start with commitment for 1% of wage lended, until our awareness will rise?\r\nDo you feel like getting above average World person?\r\n  Keep in mind, there is a small risk of no return as well, which you can adjust next year!\r\n You can add gift certificates as well.",

Check the facts about Poorest country! http://myrayana.blogspot.com/2011/03/top-10-poorest-countries-in-world-2011.html\r\n\r\n2) Read Empowering report http://Sn.im/EthicMoney:\r\n2.1) Let's Think SPENDING money as a voting tickets.

                "description": "Alan's account of the founding of LLL is on the  team board @Alan re: #260143. Loans that are nearing expiry won't get funded if they don't get noticed. We look for loans that are about to expire by using the Sort By:\r\n\"Expiring Soon\" option instead of the default \"Popularity\", and then work to get them funded.\r\n\r\nSee our team FAQ, linked above (the \"Team Website\" button, next to our traffic light avatar).\r\n\r\nA Team LLL glossary (contributed by team member Tony):\r\n\r\nRed Loans: Loans that have less than five days to be funded, identifiable by the red box \r\nwith the notice that says \"Only x days left!\" or \r\n\"Only x hours and y minutes left!\"\r\n\r\nLLL - Late Loaning Lenders: this team, where \r\nlenders work together to keep loans from \r\nexpiring.\r\n\r\nSFDD - Starfish Daily Dozen: Under current \r\npractice, one of these lists is prepared and \r\nposted for each day, to help LLL lenders focus \r\nand coordinate their lending on a targeted \r\ngroup of loans (the Starfish or SF). The lists \r\nare prepared by a group of volunteers who \r\nseek to be objective in selecting the loans to \r\nbe included in their lists. They also seek to \r\nspread out the loans in each list over a 24 hour \r\nperiod and to share the joy among the Field \r\nPartners with loans expiring during that period, \r\nbut their efforts are always constrained by the \r\nchoice of loans that are available for inclusion \r\nin the list. Loans with larger amounts needed \r\nwill be included in the period immediately after \r\neach Credit Day, when lenders are feeling \r\nflush, but the lists will become less ambitious \r\nwhen the LLL lenders are feeling poor.\r\n\r\nGG - Gorgeous Group: The SFDD list-makers have the option of adding one or two of these \r\nloans after their SFDD lists. As the name \r\nimplies, only group loans are picked. When it is \r\nfirst posted, a typical GG loan will expire two \r\ndays or more after the list is posted. It will \r\nusually be retained as a GG until it becomes \r\nFully Funded or moves into Starfish range. The amount needed when the loan is selected as a GG will vary depending on the time of month.\r\n\r\nRTR - Reduce the Red: These lists are \r\nprepared and posted when there are large \r\nnumbers of loans slated to expire in a short \r\nperiod of time. \"Red\" is a reference to the red \r\nboxes that are added to a loan description \r\nwhen the Loan is about to expire without full \r\nfunding.\r\n\r\nBTB - Battling the Boxes: On those days where \r\nthere aren't 12 loans that qualify as \"Starfish,\" \r\nthe listmakers will include BTB loans to help \r\nfocus attention on the red-boxed loans with the best chances. The criteria are similar to SF \r\nloans, i.e., one per field partner and reasonable \r\namounts left to fund (not too much; not too \r\nlittle), except that these loans may have a longer time left before their expiry date. If they gain good traction on their first BTB day, they may be carried forward. If not ... they stand a second chance as SF.\r\n\r\nBulge: A short period in which a great many \r\nloans have their scheduled funding expiration \r\ntimes. Bulges come about primarily when a \r\nField Partner (FP) submits an amount of loans \r\nto Kiva than is greater than the FP's quota. The loan \r\ndescriptions are prepared for posting by \r\ntranslating the loan descriptions (if necessary) \r\nand editing them, and they are then held in a queue by Kiva's server, to be posted when the FP has freed up some of its credit limit on Kiva, by making some repayments. Bulge loans are prize candidates for inclusion \r\nin Reduce the Red lists.\r\n\r\nFF - Fully Funded: This is LLL code for a loan \r\nthat has received all the loans required for it to be removed from the list of loans that are raising funds \r\nand to move into paying back status.\r\n\r\nLars Ratio: the average funding per hour that is needed for a loan to become fully funded.\r\n(Developed by team member Lars)\r\n\r\nWiedergänger (contributed by Maria) - German expression, literal translation \"again walker,\" meaning \"undead,\" i.e. a person that has died but comes back, aka a zombie. Here it means a loan that disappears from the page, but comes back again because somebody didn't check out their basket.\r\n\r\nRuma sana (contributed by Jouko and Potkukelkka) - Finnish expression, literal translation \"ugly words.\"  It is a phrase to use when you are very frustrated, but want to stop just short of actual cursing -- for example, when the Kiva site repeatedly logs you out when you are trying to rescue an expiring loan at the last second.\r\n\r\nSee data about all loans currently fundraising on Kiva:\r\nwww.kivatools.com\r\nSee data about loans that have been mentioned on the LLL board, including the most recent lending activity on each loan:\r\nhttp://starfish.dynalias.org/\r\nSee loans in real time, as they are made:\r\nhttp://www.http://kivalive.com/index2.php\r\n\r\nLists are posted on the LLL Team message \r\nboard.
