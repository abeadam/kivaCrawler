The mental health budget from Bali's governor was cut by 90% last year.\r\n\r\nThe few Indonesian psychological institutions that exist look more like a prision then a hospital. Patients are left by themselves and are even starving as there is not enough food. Check out: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RB3MJGjXoH4 (Indonesia's mentally ill mistreated and starving)\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of cases on Bali, where the families hide their mental ill family members, because they are ashamed. They believe mental illness is a curse, because of to little dedication to religion, and therefore it's a punishment by the gods. \r\n\r\nAs the mental ill patients sometimes show “strange“ behavior, their family puts them in heavy iron chains or lock them away in cages or wooden sheds for the rest of their lives. There are even reported cases that mental ill are brought to the jungle, where they die of starvation.\r\n",
                "description": "We are shocked about - Paradise Island - Bali's hidden and dark secret: the inhuman suffering and torturing of mental ill patients. \r\n\r\nTherefore we are very impressed by the good work of Dr. Luh Ketut Suryuni of the Suryani Institute. \r\n\r\nWith the resources the institute has today, who is mainly depending on donations, she is able to help about 600 patients. Just 1 injection every 2 weeks can help a patient to live a relatively normal life, but these drugs are very expensive. Dr. Suryani visits her patients as much as she can and also educate their families, so they no longer lock them up. \r\n\r\nCheck out: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-NWiCViXc0 (The Dark Side of Paradise. Mental Illness in Bali) and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCxmuEf7lM (101East – Bali breakdown) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXzyqU-x52c&feature=related (Bali's Shame)\r\n\r\nDr. Suryani is also president of the CASA organization, a Committee Against Sexual Abuse. Bali sees a rising number of foreign pedofiles, who are abusing children from remote areas, pretending to be “sugar daddies“. \r\n",

Requests range from pencils for a poetry writing unit, to violins for a school recital, to microscope slides for a biology class.\r\n\r\nThen, you can browse project requests and give any amount to the one that inspires you. Once a project reaches its funding goal, we deliver the materials to the school.\r\n\r\nYou'll get photos of your project taking place, a thank-you letter from the teacher, and a cost report showing how each dollar was spent. If you give over $50, you'll also receive hand-written thank-you letters from the students.\r\n\r\nAt DonorsChoose.org, you can give as little as $1 and get the same level of choice, transparency, and feedback that is traditionally reserved for someone who gives millions.

Requests range from pencils for a poetry writing unit, to violins for a school recital, to microscope slides for a biology class.\r\n\r\nThen, you can browse project requests and give any amount to the one that inspires you. Once a project reaches its funding goal, we deliver the materials to the school.\r\n\r\nYou'll get photos of your project taking place, a thank-you letter from the teacher, and a cost report showing how each dollar was spent. If you give over $50, you'll also receive hand-written thank-you letters from the students.\r\n\r\nAt DonorsChoose.org, you can give as little as $1 and get the same level of choice, transparency, and feedback that is traditionally reserved for someone who gives millions. We call it citizen philanthropy.",

Requests range from pencils for a poetry writing unit, to violins for a school recital, to microscope slides for a biology class.\r\n\r\nThen, you can browse project requests and give any amount to the one that inspires you. Once a project reaches its funding goal, we deliver the materials to the school.\r\n\r\nYou'll get photos of your project taking place, a thank-you letter from the teacher, and a cost report showing how each dollar was spent. If you give over $50, you'll also receive hand-written thank-you letters from the students.\r\n\r\nAt DonorsChoose.org, you can give as little as $1 and get the same level of choice, transparency, and feedback that is traditionally reserved for someone who gives millions. We call it citizen philanthropy.",

Now we are continuing our involvement with Turame in an even more hands-on-way - by becoming microfinance lenders. \r\n\r\nHow to get involved:\r\n1. Click the join team button to the left [if you are new to Kiva you will need to create an account].\r\n\r\n2. Choose a Borrower: Check out the current Turame loans by scrolling down at this link: [http://bit.ly/pGU0sd] If there are no new loans, check back in as Turame posts new loans twice a month.\r\n\r\n3. Make a Loan:\r\n\r\n4. Get Repaid: Over the course of 6 months your loan will get repaid to you in the form of Kiva credit. [This is a loan, not a donation]\r\n\r\n5. Repeat.  You can take the money and put it back in your pocket or make a loan to another group.\r\n\r\nThanks for helping support Turame Community Finance in providing loans to those living in one of the poorest countries on the planet. \r\nYou can learn more about Turame here: www.kiva.org/partners/162",
