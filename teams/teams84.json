As the man approached he could see that there were hundreds of starfish stranded on the sand as the result of the natural action of the tide.\r\n\r\nThe man was stuck by the the apparent futility of the task. There were far too many starfish. Many of them were sure to perish. As he approached the person continued the task of picking up starfish one by one and throwing them into the surf.\r\n\r\nAs he came up to the person he said, \"You must be crazy. There are thousands of miles of beach covered with starfish. You can't possibly make a difference.\" The person looked at the man. He then stooped down and pick up one more starfish and threw it back into the ocean. He turned back to the man and said, \"It sure made a difference to that one!\"",

Médecins Sans Frontières is an international medical humanitarian organization created by doctors and journalists in France in 1971.\r\n\r\nAccording to their website, MSF provides aid in nearly 60 countries to people whose survival is threatened by violence, neglect, or catastrophe, primarily due to armed conflict, epidemics, malnutrition, exclusion from health care, or natural disasters.\r\n\r\nMSF operates independently of any political, military, or religious agenda.  In 1999, MSF won the Nobel Peace Prize.\r\n\r\nThe Kiva team is not officially linked to MSF. All loans made in the name of this team, remain the property of the lender, and are not considered a donation.",
