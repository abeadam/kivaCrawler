That's a little steep. So, if you don't want to donate that much, PayPal me (jordy.clements@gmail.com) or Dwolla me (812-735-3988) or mail me or hand me $10, and I will donated on your behalf. \r\n\r\nIf we don't get to the goal, I'll try to make up the difference, and if we do make it there, hey, maybe I'll give a little more. Plus, remember it's Kiva: YOU'RE PROBABLY GETTING ALL YOUR MONEY BACK.\r\n\r\nAnd oh, by the way. \r\n\r\nThanks. \r\n\r\n{see you next year}",

Now we are continuing our involvement with Turame in an even more hands-on-way - by becoming microfinance lenders. \r\n\r\nHow to get involved:\r\n1. Click the join team button to the left [if you are new to Kiva you will need to create an account].\r\n\r\n2. Choose a Borrower: Check out the current Turame loans by scrolling down at this link: [http://bit.ly/pGU0sd] If there are no new loans, check back in as Turame posts new loans twice a month.\r\n\r\n3. Make a Loan:\r\n\r\n4. Get Repaid: Over the course of 6 months your loan will get repaid to you in the form of Kiva credit. [This is a loan, not a donation]\r\n\r\n5. Repeat.  You can take the money and put it back in your pocket or make a loan to another group.\r\n\r\nThanks for helping support Turame Community Finance in providing loans to those living in one of the poorest countries on the planet. \r\nYou can learn more about Turame here: www.kiva.org/partners/162",
