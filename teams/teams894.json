Susan was only 41 years old, and her 3 year old son, husband, parents, friends and family will all miss her dearly. \r\n\r\nSusan was a counselor who helped many people to tear down whatever wasn't working in their lives.  Even with no hair Susan had the most positive outlook, and was always living her best life at every possible moment.  To many it was such a blessing to have known Susan, and to have had the chance to walk some of the best footsteps of life with her.\r\n\r\nJust a few weeks before her death a dear friend asked Susan if there was anything she could do for her, and Susan's request was to please send some money to a family that she wanted to help for Christmas. Even up to the end Susan was giving and helping others. ",

Comeau-Nguyen Pay it Forward Fund is dedicated to carrying forthword Susan's incredible spirit, honoring her generous heart, and keeping her forever a star in the sky. \r\n\r\nSusan's wishes, in lieu of a service, were for people to donate microloans through Kiva.  Susan asked that we all pay it forward by doing an extravagantly generous act of kindness or service, either intentional or random, for stranger or friend, for someone in need.  \r\nSusan....YOU GOT IT!

In 2011 'Genealogists for Families' received an award for Best New Community Project.\r\n\r\nThrough Kiva, a non-profit organisation working with microfinance institutions, you choose a borrower to support with a loan of just $5 (through Kiva Zip) or $25 (on the main Kiva site). Similar loans by other lenders are combined until the required total is reached. This enables people without access to traditional banks (including many women) to expand their businesses, support and educate their children, save for the future and raise themselves out of poverty. As your money is repaid (often in monthly instalments), you can withdraw it or lend it to someone else. Money that is loaned over and over again does more good than a one-time donation!\r\n\r\nAnyone *who makes a loan* through Kiva can be a member of this team. You can invite your family and friends to join even if they are not involved in genealogy.\r\n\r\n** Please read http://genfamilies.blogspot.com/search/label/FAQ (which has important information and answers to frequently asked questions).",
