We agree that the church exists for the benefit of its non-members and that God’s interest is both personal and social, individual and systemic.\r\n\r\nSo we serve by partnering with organizations and meeting needs.",

Critical Mass is a fantastic, fun time, so come join the ride!\r\n\r\n(The Derailleur, June 2003)",
