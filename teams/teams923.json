                "description": "Dear friends and family,\r\n\r\nAs my birthday and the holidays approach, I have been asked the question for the 37th year in a row “So….. what do you want?”\r\n\r\nAs most of you know, the last couple of years have been a big transition for me, turning my career towards the issue of poverty in developing countries. Last year while living in South Africa, Melissa, Sadie, Cole and I saw firsthand how people in poverty live. I’ve learned how poor people don’t really want “hand outs”, but could certainly use a “hand up”.\r\n\r\nThis holiday season, the only gift I really want is for my friends and family to experience what that means to me. All it will take is 25 minutes and a loan of $25. KIVA.org is a website that allows you to make a $25 loan to a micro-entrepreneur in a developing country, so that they can build a business to develop income and provide for their family. On the website, you can choose the specific entrepreneur and the business that you want to lend to: for example a restaurateur in Cambodia, a goat herder in Uganda, or a farmer in Peru. Since 2005, KIVA has provided over 340,000 loans worth $260M dollars with an amazing 98.3% repayment rate. That means you not only help someone get their business off the ground, but history says there is a 98.3% chance you get your $25 back! KIVA has won many awards, and has been profiled by Time Magazine, Fortune, New York Times, not to mention being named as one of Oprah’s favorite things.\r\n\r\nI’ve created an online lending team with KIVA called “Friends of Sadie and Cole” and am hoping you can help me get to a total of 25 loans on there by Dec 25. Click here: http://www.kiva.org/team/friends_of_sadie_and_cole to learn more.\r\n\r\nHere’s a short video on how it works: http://vimeo.com/16991128\r\n\r\n25 minutes and $25 could be a game changer to help someone in the developing world get on their feet in 2012. Would love to hear your opinions and what you thought about the experience. \r\n\r\nThanks and looking forward to celebrating this holiday season with you, whether in person or from afar!\r\n\r\nAlbert",

Whether we are Jewish or Greek, slave or free, God gave all of us one Spirit to drink. As you know, the human body is not made up of only one part, but of many parts. Suppose a foot says, \"I'm not a hand, so I'm not part of the body!\" Would that mean it's no longer part of the body? Or suppose an ear says, \"I'm not an eye, so I'm not a part of the body!\" Would that mean it's no longer part of the body? If the whole body were an eye, how could it hear? If the whole body were an ear, how could it smell? So God put each and every part of the body together as he wanted it. How could it be a body if it only had one part? So there are many parts but one body.\"\r\n(God's Word Translation 1995)",

Students organize chapters to join with like-minded students in their community and\r\naround the country to raise money to battle poverty, not with sympathy, but with business transactions rooted in mutual dignity. Kiva U is guided by\r\nthese goals, which we affirm to be our mission:\r\n\r\n • To inspire awareness of global issues, especially poverty and hunger;\r\n\r\n• To bring together and subsequently organize students interested in fighting\r\npoverty;\r\n\r\n• To encourage interest in microfinance as a tool to combat poverty;\r\n\r\n• To raise money to invest in worthy entrepreneurs in developing states,\r\ncountering the predatory loaning practices so prevalent among the world's poorest regions;\r\n\r\n• To develop in its members a sense of global responsibility;\r\n\r\n• To enable others to become more aware of global issues such as poverty\r\nand help them realize the power of microfinance;\r\n\r\n• To establish a network of high school chapters around the country in which\r\nthis organization will be a central resource;\r\n\r\n• To allow high school students to play a direct role in alleviating global\r\npoverty through loans to entrepreneurs in the developing world.",

                "description": "Dear friends and family,\r\n\r\nAs my birthday and the holidays approach, I have been asked the question for the 37th year in a row “So….. what do you want?”\r\n\r\nAs most of you know, the last couple of years have been a big transition for me, turning my career towards the issue of poverty in developing countries. Last year while living in South Africa, Melissa, Sadie, Cole and I saw firsthand how people in poverty live. I’ve learned how poor people don’t really want “hand outs”, but could certainly use a “hand up”.\r\n\r\nThis holiday season, the only gift I really want is for my friends and family to experience what that means to me. All it will take is 25 minutes and a loan of $25. KIVA.org is a website that allows you to make a $25 loan to a micro-entrepreneur in a developing country, so that they can build a business to develop income and provide for their family. On the website, you can choose the specific entrepreneur and the business that you want to lend to: for example a restaurateur in Cambodia, a goat herder in Uganda, or a farmer in Peru. Since 2005, KIVA has provided over 340,000 loans worth $260M dollars with an amazing 98.3% repayment rate. That means you not only help someone get their business off the ground, but history says there is a 98.3% chance you get your $25 back! KIVA has won many awards, and has been profiled by Time Magazine, Fortune, New York Times, not to mention being named as one of Oprah’s favorite things.\r\n\r\nI’ve created an online lending team with KIVA called “Friends of Sadie and Cole” and am hoping you can help me get to a total of 25 loans on there by Dec 25. Click here: http://www.kiva.org/team/friends_of_sadie_and_cole to learn more.\r\n\r\nHere’s a short video on how it works: http://vimeo.com/16991128\r\n\r\n25 minutes and $25 could be a game changer to help someone in the developing world get on their feet in 2012. Would love to hear your opinions and what you thought about the experience. \r\n\r\nThanks and looking forward to celebrating this holiday season with you, whether in person or from afar!\r\n\r\nAlbert",
