We have no religious, racial or political affiliations of any kind. We want to encourage sustainable enterprises that recycle, reuse, repurpose and use environmentally sound agricultural and manufacturing practices. \r\nMany of us would like Kiva to develop environmental standards or criteria for their lending practices to prevent environmental impacts that would increase poverty for future generations.\r\nMany people want to have a green portfolio, or at least a green component. \r\nWon't you join us in creating true sustainability that includes a healthy environment?",

We feel blessed to be able to support the aspirations of so many loan recipients who persevere tenaciously for a better quality of life with dignity. Kudos to Kiva.org that allows us to connect for this common cause.",
                "description": "In our team, we have a vision to change lives in novel ways. Our team's origin began with a Kiva Card (gift certificate) whose recipient founded this team. Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

Although most of these loans are \r\npre-funded by the Field Partners, the Field\r\nPartners lose out on the capital if a loan\r\ndoesn't get funded on Kiva. We believe that \r\nthis will damage the Field Partners in the long \r\nterm and impair their capacity to make loans to new borrowers.\r\n\r\nWe can't save every red loan, but we try to\r\nmake a difference as in the Starfish Story:\r\nhttp://67.199.70.191/articles/the-starfish-story.aspx\r\nHelp us fund loans we're already supporting:\r\nhttp://www.kiva.org/team/late_loaning_lenders/loans?status=fundRaising\r\n\r\n\r\nCheck out Charlotte's Web: http://starfish.dynalias.org\r\n\r\nThis watchlist for loans suggested by the team members (starfish + offlist) shows:\r\n* the current position in the popularity ranking (considering pages 1 to 5)\r\n* the timestamp of the most recent loan\r\n* the basket amount\r\nClick magnifier icon for more info.

                "description": "Alan's account of the founding of LLL is on the  team board @Alan re: #260143. Loans that are nearing expiry won't get funded if they don't get noticed. We look for loans that are about to expire by using the Sort By:\r\n\"Expiring Soon\" option instead of the default \"Popularity\", and then work to get them funded.\r\n\r\nSee our team FAQ, linked above (the \"Team Website\" button, next to our traffic light avatar).\r\n\r\nA Team LLL glossary (contributed by team member Tony):\r\n\r\nRed Loans: Loans that have less than five days to be funded, identifiable by the red box \r\nwith the notice that says \"Only x days left!\" or \r\n\"Only x hours and y minutes left!\"\r\n\r\nLLL - Late Loaning Lenders: this team, where \r\nlenders work together to keep loans from \r\nexpiring.\r\n\r\nSFDD - Starfish Daily Dozen: Under current \r\npractice, one of these lists is prepared and \r\nposted for each day, to help LLL lenders focus \r\nand coordinate their lending on a targeted \r\ngroup of loans (the Starfish or SF). The lists \r\nare prepared by a group of volunteers who \r\nseek to be objective in selecting the loans to \r\nbe included in their lists. They also seek to \r\nspread out the loans in each list over a 24 hour \r\nperiod and to share the joy among the Field \r\nPartners with loans expiring during that period, \r\nbut their efforts are always constrained by the \r\nchoice of loans that are available for inclusion \r\nin the list. Loans with larger amounts needed \r\nwill be included in the period immediately after \r\neach Credit Day, when lenders are feeling \r\nflush, but the lists will become less ambitious \r\nwhen the LLL lenders are feeling poor.\r\n\r\nGG - Gorgeous Group: The SFDD list-makers have the option of adding one or two of these \r\nloans after their SFDD lists. As the name \r\nimplies, only group loans are picked. When it is \r\nfirst posted, a typical GG loan will expire two \r\ndays or more after the list is posted. It will \r\nusually be retained as a GG until it becomes \r\nFully Funded or moves into Starfish range. The amount needed when the loan is selected as a GG will vary depending on the time of month.\r\n\r\nRTR - Reduce the Red: These lists are \r\nprepared and posted when there are large \r\nnumbers of loans slated to expire in a short \r\nperiod of time. \"Red\" is a reference to the red \r\nboxes that are added to a loan description \r\nwhen the Loan is about to expire without full \r\nfunding.\r\n\r\nBTB - Battling the Boxes: On those days where \r\nthere aren't 12 loans that qualify as \"Starfish,\" \r\nthe listmakers will include BTB loans to help \r\nfocus attention on the red-boxed loans with the best chances. The criteria are similar to SF \r\nloans, i.e., one per field partner and reasonable \r\namounts left to fund (not too much; not too \r\nlittle), except that these loans may have a longer time left before their expiry date. If they gain good traction on their first BTB day, they may be carried forward. If not ... they stand a second chance as SF.\r\n\r\nBulge: A short period in which a great many \r\nloans have their scheduled funding expiration \r\ntimes. Bulges come about primarily when a \r\nField Partner (FP) submits an amount of loans \r\nto Kiva than is greater than the FP's quota. The loan \r\ndescriptions are prepared for posting by \r\ntranslating the loan descriptions (if necessary) \r\nand editing them, and they are then held in a queue by Kiva's server, to be posted when the FP has freed up some of its credit limit on Kiva, by making some repayments. Bulge loans are prize candidates for inclusion \r\nin Reduce the Red lists.\r\n\r\nFF - Fully Funded: This is LLL code for a loan \r\nthat has received all the loans required for it to be removed from the list of loans that are raising funds \r\nand to move into paying back status.\r\n\r\nLars Ratio: the average funding per hour that is needed for a loan to become fully funded.\r\n(Developed by team member Lars)\r\n\r\nWiedergänger (contributed by Maria) - German expression, literal translation \"again walker,\" meaning \"undead,\" i.e. a person that has died but comes back, aka a zombie. Here it means a loan that disappears from the page, but comes back again because somebody didn't check out their basket.\r\n\r\nRuma sana (contributed by Jouko and Potkukelkka) - Finnish expression, literal translation \"ugly words.\"  It is a phrase to use when you are very frustrated, but want to stop just short of actual cursing -- for example, when the Kiva site repeatedly logs you out when you are trying to rescue an expiring loan at the last second.\r\n\r\nSee data about all loans currently fundraising on Kiva:\r\nwww.kivatools.com\r\nSee data about loans that have been mentioned on the LLL board, including the most recent lending activity on each loan:\r\nhttp://starfish.dynalias.org/\r\nSee loans in real time, as they are made:\r\nhttp://www.http://kivalive.com/index2.php\r\n\r\nLists are posted on the LLL Team message \r\nboard.

                "description": "The South Bronx suffers from environmental degradation, crippling poverty, endemic public health problems, and low educational aspirations among its youth. Sustainable South Bronx (SSBx) is a community organization dedicated to Environmental Justice through innovative, economically sustainable projects that are informed by community needs. Founded in 2001 Majora Carter, SSBx is dedicated to the environmental and economic revitalization of the South Bronx, a once wealthy community whose mid-20th century collapse has since made it a national symbol for urban decay.  \r\n\r\nSustainable South Bronx operates in the Hunts Point neighborhood, part of New York's 16th  congressional district, which has been the poorest in the United States for decades. 45% of its residents (and 50% of its children) live at or below the national poverty line. Only 40% of adults have a high school diploma, and its unemployment rate (24%) is New York City's highest. The population is mostly Hispanic (63.3%) and African American (32.4%), with 30% of who do not speak English.\r\n\r\nAddressing the issues confronting the South Bronx today requires a comprehensive approach.  Individual projects within each program area are generally carried out in collaboration with other community organizations and nonprofits, government agencies, elected officials, as well as for-profit entities.  \r\n• Sustainable Policy, Research & Evaluation, and Solid Waste and Energy Advocacy:  Through in-depth research, position statements, crafting legislation, and building city-wide coalitions this program helps to identify environmental policy issues of concern to the community, and to spur the creation of specific initiatives for sustainable development.   SSBx helped write legislation for the successful passage of New York City Local Law 5, which requires the City to rigorously assess the benefits and costs of best management practices for storm water management.  In June 2008, SSBx also helped the NY State Assembly pass a bill (A.11226) that will provide a tax abatement to building owners for the installation of rooftop vegetation systems (“Green Roofs”) that cover 50% or more of their building.  The New York State legislature passed the bill, which will allow New York City building owners to receive a Green Roof tax abatement that will reimburse installation costs by up to $100,000.  Our Solid Waste and Energy advocacy efforts play a crucial role in South Bronx activism by coordinating and managing the participation of community organizations in a range of advocacy campaigns surrounding solid waste and energy.  Program staff spearhead information sessions with community leaders and actions such as press conferences, meetings with elected officials, and testimony at hearings.  Additionally, we have completed a feasibility study for an Eco-Industrial park. If developed, this Eco-Industrial Park would offer over 330 living-wage jobs, reduce truck traffic, and become a model  of green manufacturing.\r\n• Community Outreach & Education: This program trains South Bronx community members to become activists and leaders by identifying local problems and work to create solutions.  In addition, this program serves as the education arm of SSBx, partnering with the Advocacy program staff to teach area public school students and other residents about issues of concern, such as public health dangers like obesity and asthma, and how they can take action.  \r\n \r\n\r\n• Workforce Training: The Bronx Environmental Stewardship Training (B. E.S.T.) program serves as a centerpiece to the work of SSBx.  Launched to link both environmental justice and social justice, the program offers participants the opportunity to gain skills and certifications in ecological restoration, hazardous waste cleanup, landscaping and other similar fields. Consisting of three teen-week sessions per year, the B.E.S.T. program trains twenty predominantly low-income individuals per session, approximately 30% of which have been formerly incarcerated.   The success of B.E.S.T. has helped launch a national “Green-collar” job movement, inspiring SSBx to extend our green-collar workforce training to both Green Building retrofitting and eco-conscious design and manufacturing. \r\n• Greenway: South Bronx residents have far less open space and waterfront access than other parts of NYC. SSBx has played a joint-community role in the implementation of the South Bronx Greenway, which will consist of eleven miles of safe, outdoor recreation space in the South Bronx.   SSBx raised funds to hire two graduates of our B.E.S.T. program to serve as Greenway Stewards (GWS).  The GWS have ensured the survival of newly planted trees in the Hunts Point peninsula, identified new planting opportunities, and provided enhanced maintenance in two newly opened waterfront parks along the Greenway.\r\n• Sustainable Ventures: Sustainable Ventures is a program which seeks to economically empower South Bronx residents by giving them a role in “Green” industries.  It is an initiative to incubate businesses that are triple-bottom-line:  People, Planet, and Profit.   Our first venture is SmartRoofs, LLC, our Green Roof installation program.   We aim to create a profitable business that will not only raise revenue for the organization, but also create earned income opportunities for graduates of our B.E.S.T. program, who learn how to learn how to install and maintain green roofs during their B.E.S.T. training. Thus becoming the future workforce as SmartRoofs LLC increases its market share. We aim to expand the services of the LLC to include other green building components, such as audits and retrofits.  The ensuing LLC will also generate earned income opportunities for SSBx, while raising the organization’s profile and promoting green technologies in the Bronx and beyond.\r\n• SSBxFab:  SSBxFab, the latest initiative of SSBx, grew from a partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s International FabLab program. It is aimed at inspiring a generation of South Bronx-based environmentally conscious designers and inventors.  Begun in the Center for Bits and Atoms research consortium at MIT, the international FabLab (Fabrication Laboratory) program has spread throughout the world, with a mission to promote digital design and manufacturing as a means for economic empowerment.  Our program will be an opportunity for residents in a low-income area to cross the “digital divide” and learn advanced computer skills, while at the same time be at the cutting edge of design and manufacturing technology.   Our facilities will serve not only as a training center, but also as a small scale eco-industrial factory that will transform salvaged wood, metal, and plastics into consumer products, such as furniture.

Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

Rather than gaining skills to be utilized exclusively for themselves and their immediate families, the founders of Phi Beta Sigma held a deep conviction that they should return their newly acquired skills to the communities from which they had come. This deep conviction was mirrored in the Fraternity's motto, \"Culture For Service and Service For Humanity\".",
