A win for our Kiva project is to help as many opening business’ and agricultures for the better of the community.

By seeing what is happening to that specific location from Kiva.\r\n· Are budget is raising money to buy like a game console.

That's a little steep. So, if you don't want to donate that much, PayPal me (jordy.clements@gmail.com) or Dwolla me (812-735-3988) or mail me or hand me $10, and I will donated on your behalf. \r\n\r\nIf we don't get to the goal, I'll try to make up the difference, and if we do make it there, hey, maybe I'll give a little more.
