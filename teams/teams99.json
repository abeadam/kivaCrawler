We believe that Kiva is a good starting point. We believe in Kiva! We, the citizens of Catalonia, want to be committed with everyone. Our language is Catalan. We love Gaudi and his Sagrada Família. We like Miró, Dalí, and Tapies paintings. We listen to Pau Casals, Isaac Albéniz, and Enrique Granados. We build up Castellers, an extraordinary example of what human collaboration can achieve. We dance Sardanes and sing Habaneres. We eat Calçots, Paella, Escudella, Allioli, Panellets, Crema Catalana, Mato, and pa amb tomàquet. La Costa Brava, la Costa Daurada, l'Empordà, els Pirineus... all of them are beautiful places from Catalunya. We live by the Mediterranean sea. We like sports (Barça and Espanyol are two good examples). We believe in people, and thus we like to see how Sagrada Família is being built thanks to the backing of many people. We are ruled by the Generalitat and we drink from the Muga, Fluvià, Ter, Ebre, Llobregat, Besos, Anoia, Segre, Noguera, and we like hiking in Collserola, Tibidabo, Montjuïc, Montserrat, la Pica d'Estats. We ride at Montmelo F1 circuit, we produce Cava and wine in serveral areas (Montsant, Vallès, Alella, Conca de Barbera, Costers del Segre, Emporda, Penedes, Pla de Bages, Priorat i la Terra Alta). We are proud of our land and culture. Everyone is welcome to our home. We live in one of the best places of the world. Let's make the rest of them great too!",

Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

We like Miró, Dalí, and Tapies paintings. We listen to Pau Casals, Isaac Albéniz, and Enrique Granados. We build up Castellers, an extraordinary example of what human collaboration can achieve. We dance Sardanes and sing Habaneres. We eat Calçots, Paella, Escudella, Allioli, Panellets, Crema Catalana, Mato, and pa amb tomàquet. La Costa Brava, la Costa Daurada, l'Empordà, els Pirineus... all of them are beautiful places from Catalunya. We live by the Mediterranean sea. We like sports (Barça and Espanyol are two good examples). We believe in people, and thus we like to see how Sagrada Família is being built thanks to the backing of many people. We are ruled by the Generalitat and we drink from the Muga, Fluvià, Ter, Ebre, Llobregat, Besos, Anoia, Segre, Noguera, and we like hiking in Collserola, Tibidabo, Montjuïc, Montserrat, la Pica d'Estats. We ride at Montmelo F1 circuit, we produce Cava and wine in serveral areas (Montsant, Vallès, Alella, Conca de Barbera, Costers del Segre, Emporda, Penedes, Pla de Bages, Priorat i la Terra Alta). We are proud of our land and culture. Everyone is welcome to our home. We live in one of the best places of the world. Let's make the rest of them great too!",

                "description": "In our team, we have a vision to change lives in novel ways. Our team's origin began with a Kiva Card (gift certificate) whose recipient founded this team. Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.

Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent & occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor & Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity & portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http://kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.
