Não é\r\nele, é Humanitas...\r\n- Mas que Humanitas é esse?\r\n- Humanitas é o princípio. Há nas cousas todas certa substância recôndita e idêntica, um princípio único, universal, eterno, comum, indivisível e indestrutível, - ou, para usar a linguagem do grande Camões:\r\n\r\nUma verdade que nas cousas anda \r\nQue mora no visíbil e no invisíbil.\r\n\r\nPois essa substância ou verdade, esse princípio indestrutível é que é Humanitas.
